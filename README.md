The Data Science Workbook (DSW) is a publically accessible online resource that supports the inevitable shift toward **computational approaches in modern research**. The platform hosts a systematic collection of `know-how articles` and `practical tutorials`, designed to educate, provide `hands-on experience`, and bridge specialized domain knowledge of individuals with current technological advancement. The DSW is an accessible gateway for a diverse audience, allowing beginners and seasoned professionals to navigate the use of academic `computing infrastructures` in real-life research scenarios.

At its core, DSW facilitates an easily digestible introduction to the computational environment for subject matter experts, making it ideal for beginners to start from scratch and advance progressively to fluency. Specifically, it transforms the daunting task of shifting from a graphical user interface (GUI) to a `command-line interface` (CLI) into an achievable goal, introducing the foundational topics like **computer setup**, **command-line basics**, and **development environment** before advancing to more complex areas such as **high-performance computing (HPC)**, **programming**, and large-scale **data wrangling**. Further content spans vital areas, including basics of **algorithmic thinking**, **data processing**, and **visualization**, as well as elements of **project management**, each contributing significantly to the practically applicable data science. Each section is a stepping stone, building upon the last, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive learning experience.
