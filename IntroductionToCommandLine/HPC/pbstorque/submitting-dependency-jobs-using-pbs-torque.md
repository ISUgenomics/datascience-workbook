# Submitting dependency jobs using PBS-Torque

To submit jobs one after the other (i.e., run second job after the completion of first), we can use `depend` function of `qsub`.

First submit the firstjob, like normal

```
qsub first_job.sub
```

You will get the output (jobid#)

```
1234567.computername
```

Second submit the second job following way,

```
qsub -W depend=afterok:1234567 second_job.sub
```

Both job will be queued, but second job won't start till the first job is finished.

The other dependencies that can be used with `-W depend=dependency:jobid` are

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| after | this job can be scheduled after job jobid begins execution. |
| afterok | this job can be scheduled after job jobid finishes successfully. |
| afternotok | this job can be scheduled after job jobid finishes unsucessfully. |
| afterany | this job can be scheduled after job jobid finishes in any state. |
| before | this job must begin execution before job jobid can be scheduled. |
| beforeok | this job must finish successfully before job jobid begins |
| beforenotok | this job must finish unsuccessfully before job jobid begins |
| beforeany | this job must finish in any state before job jobid begins |



Simple way to automate this with a bash script:

```
#!/bin/bash
FIRST=`qsub first_job.sub`
SECOND=`qsub -W depend=afterok:$FIRST second_job.sub`
THIRD=`qsub -W depend=afterok:$SECOND third_job.sub`
FOURTH=`qsub -W depend=afterok:$THIRD fourth_job.sub`
```
