# Using Supercell-Storage server for backing up and restoring data from PSC servers

 This guide will help you getting started and using the Supercell. If you haven't already gotten a username/password for PSC systems (eg., Blacklight), you need to do it now. Use the [password reset link](http://psc.edu/index.php/resources-for-users/allocations "password reset link").

### Accessing Supercell ###

SFTP is the best method to browse the files and create the directory structure you want.
```
sftp username@data.psc.xsede.org
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '128.182.112.126' to
username@data.psc.xsede.org's password:
Connected to data.psc.xsede.org.
sftp> ls
TIL11_FULL
sftp> cd TIL11_FULL/
sftp> exit
```

### Transferring files ###

Use  `rsync` to sync the directories that you need to keep in sync

```
rsync -e 'ssh -c aes128-ctr' -avP source_dir username@data.psc.xsede.org:target_dir
```

That's it! You can retrieve the data anytime by reversing the  `rsync` command.
