Many times the results generated by the bioinformatics programs are either simple text files (tab/comma seperated), pdf files or in some rare cases png/jpeg files. Here we will show you how to view these files without having to download them locally to your machine.  

### Text files ###

The text files are the easiest. You can use any of the standard UNIX commands to view them. There are many commands for this purpose such as:

|Command|Purpose|Example|Use cases|
|--|--|--|--|
|```less```|view file pagewise with more options|```less``` _filename_|use ```-S``` to avoid line wrapping, you can use arrow keys to scroll|
|```more```|view file pagewise|```more``` _filename_|use ```less``` instead|
|```cat```|catalogs the contents of a file|```cat``` _filename_|you can send the contenst of a file to clipboard or to another file using this command|
|```tac```|reverse of cat, reverses the order of lines|```tac``` _filename_|pipe this to ```less``` commad to scroll through the file in reverse|
|```head```|view first few lines of a file|```head``` _filename_|use ```-n``` option to change the number of lines displayed. ```-n 20``` displays 20 lines|
|```tail```|view last few lines of a file|```tail``` _filename_|use ``` -n``` option to change the number of lines displayed. ```-n 20``` displays 20 lines|
|```od```|octal dump of a file|```od``` _filename_|use``` -c``` options and pipe it through less. You can see non printable characters with this option (like tab, whitespace, newline etc)|




### PDF files ###

Most HPC's allows X11 forwarding. You can enable this when you are logging in to the remote host using the `-X` option. For eg.,
```
ssh -X arnstrm@condodtn.its.iastate.edu
```
Once logged in, you can now open any GUI interface programs on the remote-host and it appears as a new window in your local machine. Although, there are plenty of program options to open a `pdf` file, you can almost always find the `firefox` browser in every machine. This should be sufficient to open a `PDF` file. To get started, type:
```
firefox
```

A new window will open, then go to ```file``` >> ```open file``` >> _select the pdf file you want to open_ .
If you don't find the menu tab, pressing ```alt``` + ```f``` should bring up the ```file``` menu


### PNG files ###

Again, you need X11 forwarding enabled to do this. If your machine has ```imagemagick``` module installed, load it:

```
module load imagemagick
```
To open any picture files, you can just do:

```
display filename.png
```

If you don't have this program installed, you can try the ```firefox``` method. Although, to view ```png``` files, you may have to install the addon before you open the file. Addons are easy to add, once the firefox is opened, press ```ctrl``` + ```shift``` + ```A```, that will open ```add-ons``` page (you can also just type ```about:addons``` to open this). Search for [_Perfect View_](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/firefox/addon/perfect-view/?src=dp-dl-othersby) add-on, and add it to your ```firefox```. Now you can open the file normally as you opened the ```pdf``` files.
