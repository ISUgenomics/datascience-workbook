By learning Bash scripting and algorithm design, you can automate repetitive tasks and run them in the background of your schedule. This can save significant time, reduce the risk of human error, and improve reproducibility and standardization. In this course, you will learn the basics of Bash scripting and be introduced to two popular programming languages, R and Python. With large data sets, the benefits of this approach are even greater, providing significant savings in researcher time and increased reliability (reduced human erro, increased reproducibility and standardization).
