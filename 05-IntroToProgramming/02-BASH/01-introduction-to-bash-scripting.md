# Introduction

# 1. Bash expressions

## 1.1 Bash shortcuts

**~ EXPANSION**

`~` is a shortcut for the $HOME location in the file system

**\* and ? EXPANSION**

`*` - denotes multiple unknown characters in a string

`?` - denotes single unknown characters in a string

USAGE in regular expressions:

* in searching, e.g., with `grep` or `find`
* in listing file system, i.e., `ls`
* in filtering files processed in the **for** loop

**$ for VARIABLES**

`$variable` - to use/substitute the variable's value

## 1.2 Logical operators

### - FILE OPERATORS

-a, -b, -c, -d, -e, -f, etc.

### - STRING OPERATORS

-z, -n, = , !=, < , >

### - NUMERIC OPERATORS

-eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, -ge

## 1.3 In-shell arithmetic

### - OPERATORS

A. increment (++n, n++), decrement (--n, n--)

B. +, -, *, /, %, ^

### - LIMITATIONS (integers)

* division by 0 is prohibited
* floating-point arithmetic is not supported

### - BRACE EXPANSION



```
echo $((1+2))
```

```
echo $((x=1, y=1, x+y))
```

```
n=1;
echo $((++n))
```

### - let command

```
k=1;
let k=$k + 2
```

### - bc command

*(supports floating-point up to 20 decimal places)*

```
echo "1.5 + 2.0" | bc -l
```

### - awk command

*(supports floating-point up to 6 decimal places)*

```
awk 'BEGIN { x = 1.5; y = 1.5; print "x + y = "(x+y) }'
```

### - perl command

*(supports floating-point up to 20 decimal places)*

```
perl -e 'print 1.5+2.0'
```

## 1.4 In-line substitution

* useful as in-line generators of arguments for **for** loop

### - BRACE AUTOCOMPLETION

A. Use the array of strings<br>
*(note that there are no spaces)*
```
echo "Hello "{Universe,World,Contry,City,Friend}
```

B. Use the array of auto-generated integers
```
echo "Count "{0..10}
```

C. Use combinations of many arrays

```
echo {a,b}_{0..5}
```

### - COMMAND SUBSTITUTION

Use \`command\` syntax to create the array of items on-the-fly

```
for i in `seq 10`; do echo $i; done
```

It works for any command enclosed in the \`\`. The most comman usages are generating array of integers with `seq` command or creating an array of strings read from the one-column file.
```
for i in `seq 1 2 10`; do echo $i; done
for i in `cat one-column-file`; do echo $i; done
```

# 2. Bash statements

Bash is a Unix shell that allows you to call processes on the computing machine directly in the command line. In addition to a set of built-in commands *(check them with the `compgen -b` command)* that perform predefined tasks, you can **create your own algorithms in the Bash** shell. To give a structure to the algorithm, Bash uses several keywords and special characters that are interpreted by the Unix shell. The set of these expressions is referred to as **Bash statements** and can be understood as a set of universal **building blocks** that you can use to build your own customized algorithm.<br>
You can view the available Bash statements on the command line using the `compgen` command with the ***k*** flag:

```
compgen -k
```
![terminal colors](../assets/images/02_bash_keywords.png)<br>

There are about twenty-some Bash statements, which can be further divided into several groups, including **loops**, **conditionals**, the **action operators**, and others. The table below contains the syntax, type, and definitions of the most common Bash statements. Explore additional columns of notes to gain an idea of when to use different syntaxes. In the following subsections, we will discuss the usage of Bash statements following real-life examples.

|statement      | type               | definition | notes |
|---------------|--------------------|------------|-------|
| for           | loop               | iterating over **each item** in the list            | use if you want to execute commands in order for all items in the list<br> YES, nested loops are allowed |
| while         | loop               | iterating as long as the condition is **true**      | use if you want to perform a certain number of iterations, such as reading a file line by line<br>YES, infinite loop is possible, try `while :` |
| until         | loop               | iterating as long as the condition is **false**     | use if you want to perform an infinite number of iterations terminated by meeting a condition<br> the frequency of execution of the condition is usually adjusted with the `sleep` command |
| select        | loop               | selective iterating over options in the menu    | use to give the user the interactive option to select items from a menu (predefined list) |
| if ... fi     | conditional        | considering the first condition                 | use `if` for the first condition and `fi` after the last condition |
| elif          | conditional        | considering the next condition                  | use for the second and following conditions |
| else          | conditional        | operation for all other scenarios               | if no condition was met then follow these commands |
| case ... esac | conditional        | matching condition for query variable           | use when all of the conditions depend <br>on the value of the same variable<br> |
| in            | iteration operator | iterating in the `for` and `select` loops       |for loop syntax:<br> `pearfor item in {1..5}; do commands; done`<br> select llop syntax:<br> `select item in {1..5}; do commands; done`|
| do ... done   | action operator    | encapsulating the contents of the loop          | use the syntax: `do commands; done` in a loop syntax|

## **FOR** each item loop

**FOR** loop provides the easiest way to **iterate over the ordered list** of items (strings or integers) and execute the set of **commands for each**. <br>

The syntax is made up of several keywords reserved for the bash shell and customized arguments provided by the user. When a statement is defined in a script file, it usually has a block structure, where the contents encapsulated in `do ... done` syntax is indented by a fixed number of spaces, usually 4 or 2 for more nested algorithms.

```
for item in {first,second,third,fourth,fifth}
do
    echo $item
done
```

![terminal colors](../assets/images/02_bash_for_loop_script.png)<br>

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
In some intra-terminal text editors such as <b>mcedit</b> (part of the midnight commander package), individual components of bash syntax are highlighted in different colors, making it easier to follow the correctness of the code.
</span>
</div><br>

The `for, in, do, done` are fixed bash statement elements, performing specific functions that are interpreted by the Unix shell *(for details see table above)*. The word or character occurring between `for` and `in` is a user-provided variable that specifies the name of the iterator. Usually it is the letter ***i***, but it can be any string, which will specify the type of iterated values. In successive loop cycles *(iterations)*, the iterator takes the next value from the array and executes for it the commands contained in the `do ... done` code block.

<div style="background: mistyrose; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">WARNING:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
Avoid naming iterators and other variables with a single character since there are a finite number of letters. Overriding the iterator value inside the loop could result in algorithm failure.<br>
<b>Note:</b> The more meaningful the iterator name reflecting the type of items, the better readable the code for other programmers.
</span>
</div><br>

You can also use **FOR** loop syntax directly in the command line as a one-liner, to see the result immediately:

```
for item in {first,second,third,fourth,fifth}; do echo $item; done
```

![terminal colors](../assets/images/02_bash_for_loop_inline.png)<br>

<div style="background: mistyrose; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">WARNING:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
Remember to always separate consecutive statement elements with a semicolon <b>;</b> in single-line syntax.
</span>
</div><br>



**VARIANTS OF A FOR-LOOP SYNTAX**

*A. Iterate over strings given directly:*
```
for item in item1 item2 item3 item4 item5; do
    echo  $item
done
```

*B. Iterate over strings given in an array:*
```
for item in {item1,item2,item3,item4,item5}; do
    echo  $item
done
```

*C. Iterate over integers given in an array:*
```
for item in {1,2,3,4,5}; do
    echo  $item
done
```

*D. Iterate over integers generated automatically using an array:*
```
for item in {1..5}; do
    echo  $item
done
```
<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
You can add a step as a third argument to the array syntax, e.g., <b>{1..10..2}</b> to iterate over odd numbers.<br>
You can replace explicit integers with variables, e.g., {$START..$END..$STEP}. Note, however, that you must define them in advance and assign them a value before usage.
</span>
</div><br>

*E. Iterate over integers generated automatically using sequence:*
```
for item in `seq 1 1 10`; do
    echo  $item
done
```
<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
The syntax for generating integers in a sequence is 'seq START STEP END' or $(seq START STEP END). If your step is equal to one, you can skip the middle argument.
</span>
</div><br>

*F. Iterate over integers generated automatically using incrementation:*
```
for ((item=1;item<=END;item++)); do
    echo $item
done
```

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
You can start with a large intiger and count down using the decrementing ( item-- ).
</span>
</div><br>

*G. Iterate over any items stored in the one-column file:*
```
for item in `cat file`; do
    echo $item
done
```
<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
That syntax `cat file` is useful when iterating over a long list of strings that can be read directly from a one-column file.
</span>
</div><br>

*H. Iterate over items resulting from the command:*
```
for item in `ls | grep "txt"`; do
    echo $item
done
```
<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
That syntax `custom command` is useful when iterating over a filtrated list of files stored in current directory (or any location in a file system).
</span>
</div><br>


### - NESTED LOOPS

When you want to **iterate on an each-to-any** basis over two or more sets of features, such as creating a set of files with specific names in 3 different formats, use **nested FOR loops**.

```
# script variant
for name in {dog,cat,fish,snake,bird}; do
  for format in txt dat png; do
    echo $name.$format                   # replacing 'echo' with 'touch' will create empty files
  done
done
```

![terminal colors](../assets/images/02_bash_for_loop_nested.png)<br>

The same algorithm can be executed as a one-liner directly in the command line.
```
# one-liner variant
for name in {dog,cat,fish,snake,bird}; do for format in txt dat png; do echo $name.$format; done; done
```

![terminal colors](../assets/images/02_bash_for_loop_nested_inline.png)<br>


**Use a template for 2 nasted FOR loops**
```
for item1 in {ARRAY-OF-ITEMS}; do
  for item2 in {ARRAY-OF-ITEMS}; do
    <COMMANDS>
  done
done
```

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
As long as you are diligent in properly nesting consecutive 'for-in-do-done' statements, you can make as many inner loops as you want.<br>
<b>Note: </b>Remember that the inner loop must always be closed with the <b>done</b> keyword before the more outer loop.
</span>
</div><br>

See the previous subsection in the tutorial to learn what **other iteration options** are available than using arrays.


## **WHILE** true loop

**WHILE** loop iterates as long as the user-provided condition is **true**. So, use `while` loop statement if you want to perform a certain number of iterations, whether that number is known or not. Syntax is made up of `while ` keyword reserved for the bash shell and customized condition provided by the user in square brackets. Similarly to other Bash loops, the commands *(dependent on loop condition)* are encapsulated in the `do ... done` block of code.

**Use a template for WHILE loop**
```
while [ <CONDITION> ]
do
    <COMMANDS>
done
```

Commands are executed as long as the user-provided condition evaluates to true. Note that the **condition is evaluated** at the beginning of each iteration, so **before executing** the block of commands. The conditional could involve operators on files, strings comparison, the numerical equivalence of integer iterator, or infinity condition. To learn more about Bash logical operators, revisit section 1.2 in this tutorial. Below you can find some handy tips for different conditionals:


|FILE OPERATORS            |definition|
|-------------------|----------|
| while [ -a file ] |execute if the file or directory exists |
| while [ -d file ] |execute if the directory exists         |
| while [ -f file ] |execute if the regular file exists      |
| while [ -L file ] |execute if the file is symbolic link    |
| while [ -w file ] |execute if the file is writable         |
| while [ -x file ] |execute if the file is executable       |
| while [ -s file ] |execute if the file has a size greater than zero |
| while [file_1 -ot file_2] |execute if file_1 is older then file_2 or if only file_2 exists |


The three most common usages of this loop are iterating for **as long as the specific iterator value is not reached**, **reading the file line-by-line to the end** of the file, and for creating an **infinite loop** that runs in the background and monitors any process.<br>


### - READ FILE LINE-BY-LINE

Let's first create the simple file with several lines of content:

```
# script variant
for i in {Anna,Eric,Bob}; do
  for j in welcome; do
    for k in {London,NYC,Paris}; do
      echo $i", "$j" to "$k"." >> file;
    done;
  done;
done

# one-liner variant
for i in {Ana,Eric,Bob}; do for j in welcome; do for k in {London,NYC,Paris}; do echo $i", "$j" to "$k"." >> file; done; done; done
```

You can preview the results saved into a file using `less file` command:

![terminal colors](../assets/images/02_bash_for_create_file_content.png)<br>

Once we have a file with some content, we can read it line-by-line with a `while` loop and derive from each line the name and the city.

```
filename=./file

while read -r line; do
  echo $line | tr ',' ' ' | tr '.' ' ' | awk '{print $1,$4}'
done < "$filename"
```
![terminal colors](../assets/images/02_bash_for_create_file_content_inline.png)<br>

The `filename` variable stores the name of recently created file.

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
If you work by executing scripts rather than typing directly on the command line, it's a good practice to create a variable that stores the path to the file. Then running the same script for a different inupt only requires substituting the path or a filename at the top of the file.
</span>
</div><br>

In this case, the condition for the `while` loop is replaced by the `read` command followed by the name of the variable in which the loaded content is stored. By default, the `read` command reads a single line from a bash shell or, as in this example, a single line from a text file. The text file is inserted into the loop using `<` stream redirection. Inside the `do ... done` syntax it is possible to parse a single line from a file.

## **UNTIL** false loop

### - STOP ONCE SUCCESS

## **if-elif-else** conditional

## **break** the loop

## **continue** to next iteration

---

# 3. Command-line scripting

A. INPUT

B. STREAM

D. OUTPUT

-- PRINT ON A SCREEN

-- REDIRECT BY A PIPE LINKER

-- SAVE INTO A FILE

---

# 4. In-file scripting

## 4.1 Setting up the script

* link to the tutorial about text editors
* link to the tutorial about Bash file management (touch, cat, head, tail, less, more, etc.)

### - HEADER

Use `#!/bin/env bash` syntax at the top of your script file instead of `#!/bin/bash` as a more robust solution.

### - VARIABLES

A. FROM ARGUMENT

-- e.g., $1 as a first value provided after script name when executing

B. GLOBAL

-- outside the loop

-- exists after the loop ends

C. ITERATIVE

-- increment/decrement argument

-- list of processed files

-- disappears after leaving the loop

D. LOCAL

-- in-loop or in-if variable

-- disappears after leaving the expression

### - ALGORITHM

A. PIPE-linked stream of Commands

```
cat file | grep "keyword" | tr '-' ' ' | awk '{print $2,$4,$6}' | sort -nk1 | uniq
```

B. Encapsulation in a loop

```
for i in {0..10}; do touch file-$i; done
```

C. TEXT OUTPUTS

```
k="Hello World!"
echo $k > file
```

D. GRAPHICAL OUTPUTS

*(generate graphs with gnuplot)*

Encapsulating Gnuplot script in a bash **for** loop allows for returning image files all at once for multiple inputs.

## 4.2 Executing the script

### - FILE PERMISSIONS - `chmod`

### - EXECUTE ANY FILE - `. file`

### - RUN FROM THE PATH

-- relative path vs. absolute path

### - RUN FROM ANY PATH

A. add location to the $PATH

B. create alias in the ~/.bashrc

C. whereis command

# 5. Ready-made script examples

## IN-LINERS

e.g., row-col transpose

## FILE-SCRIPTS

e.g., in-loop gnuploting template
