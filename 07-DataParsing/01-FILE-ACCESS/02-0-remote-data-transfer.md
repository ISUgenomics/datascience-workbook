# Overview

Remote data transfer refers to the transfer of data from one location to another. It requires a network, such as the Internet, that provides the means of **transmitting the data between the source and destination devices**. It allows individuals and organizations to share and exchange information, **regardless of their physical location**.

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">NOTE:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
With remote data transfer, data can be sent from a source device, such as a computer, to a destination device, such as another computer or a server, using a variety of protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and cloud storage services.<br>
<b>Remote data transfer is not possible without a network.</b> Without a network, data can only be transferred directly between two devices using a physical connection, such as a USB drive or an external hard drive.
</span>
</div><br>

Remote data transfer can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as:
* sharing files and documents,
* backing up data,
* transferring large amounts of data between systems,
* distributing software and updates.

<span style="color: #ff3870;font-weight: 500;">Remote data transfer enables greater collaboration and productivity by making it possible to access and share information from anywhere, at any time.</span>

# Remote data transfer options

## 0. Secure Data Transfer in Science

The **need for secure data transfer in research** is paramount due to the sensitive nature of the data being transmitted. Research often involves the collection and analysis of sensitive and confidential information, such as personal information, intellectual property, trade secrets, and medical records. If this information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could have serious consequences, such as identity theft, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or loss of confidential information.

Here are some of the key reasons why secure data transfer is important in research:

* **CONFIDENTIALITY** <br>
<i>Research data often contains sensitive information that must be kept confidential to protect the privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of the research itself. Secure data transfer ensures that this information is transmitted over a secure connection and is protected from unauthorized access.</i>

* **INTEGRITY** <br>
<i>The accuracy and completeness of research data is crucial for the validity of the results. Secure data transfer helps to ensure the integrity of the data by providing mechanisms to detect and prevent any unauthorized changes or tampering with the data during transmission.</i>

* **COMPLIANCE** <br>
<i>Many research projects are subject to regulatory requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Secure data transfer helps to ensure compliance with these regulations by providing secure and encrypted methods of transmitting data.</i>

* **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY** <br>
<i>Research often involves the creation of new ideas and concepts that may have commercial value. Secure data transfer helps to protect the intellectual property of the researchers by ensuring that confidential information is transmitted securely and is protected from unauthorized access.</i>

* **EFFICIENCY** <br>
<i>Secure data transfer allows researchers to collaborate and share data in real-time, regardless of their location. This can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of research projects and can facilitate collaboration between researchers across multiple institutions.
</i>

### • *Good Practices*

When transferring any research data, there are several practices and techniques that **should be avoided** in order to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data:

* **Avoid unencrypted connections:** <br>
<i>Unencrypted connections, such as <b>FTP or HTTP are NOT secure</b> and can leave the data vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. Instead, use encrypted connections, such as SFTP, HTTPS, or VPN, to ensure that the data is transmitted securely.</i>

* **Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks:** <br>
<i>Public Wi-Fi networks are NOT secure and can be easily intercepted by unauthorized third parties. Instead, **use a secure and encrypted connection, such as a VPN**, to ensure that the data is transmitted securely.</i>

* **Avoid using weak passwords:** <br>
<i>Weak passwords can be easily cracked by attackers, putting the data at risk. Instead, use strong and unique passwords and implement multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.</i>

* **Avoid transmitting sensitive information without permission:** <br>
<i>Before transmitting sensitive data, it is important to obtain permission from the owner of the data and to ensure that the data is properly secured.</i>

* **Avoid using personal email:** <br>
<i>Personal email accounts are not designed for secure data transfer and can be vulnerable to interception, unauthorized access, and data loss. Instead, use secure file transfer services or encrypted email services that are specifically designed for secure data transfer.</i>

* **Avoid using removable media:** <br>
<i>Removable media, such as USB drives, can be easily lost or stolen, putting the data at risk. Instead, **use secure file transfer services (e.g., Globus) or encrypted cloud storage services (e.g., your organization Box)** that are specifically designed for secure data transfer.</i>

## 1. Online **File Sharing** Services
