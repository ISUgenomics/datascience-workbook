This section provides a highly verbose guide for the contents of the [ISUgenomics](https://github.com/ISUgenomics)/<b>[data_wrangling](https://github.com/ISUgenomics/data_wrangling)</b> GitHub repository. The **data_wrangling** repo collects ready-made mini-apps for popular tasks in data processing.<br>
<i>Most of the apps are <span style="color: #ff3870;"> developed in Python3</span> programming language.</i>

In the <b>[data_wrangling](https://github.com/ISUgenomics/data_wrangling)</b> repo, each application is placed in a separate directory for tidy organization.<br>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Each folder contains:</p>
<ul><li> the python script (.py) of the application </li>
<li> the example inputs </li>
<li> the documentation in the README.md file, including some usage variations (*sample commands that run the program in different option configurations*) </li></ul><br>

All the applications have a **built-in set of options** provided as in-line arguments from the command line. Thanks to that, there is **no need to modify source code** by the user (*e.g., to replace input filename or tune params*). Also, it makes the apps more universal, comprehensive, and robust.

More advanced (multi-purpose or multi-options) applications have a **built-in logger** which reports the analysis progress with the details depending on the **selected verbosity level**.

Right here, in the [Data Science Workbook](https://datascience.101workbook.org): [07-DataParsing](https://datascience.101workbook.org/07-DataParsing/00-DataParsing-LandingPage)/<b>[03-DATA-WRANGLING-APPS](https://datascience.101workbook.org/07-DataParsing/03-DATA-WRANGLING-APPS/00-data-wrangling-apps)</b> section, you can follow the <span style="color: #ff3870;">hands-on tutorials</span> to learn how to run the ready-made applications <span style="color: #ff3870;">using example datasets</span> and further employ them to support your own research.
