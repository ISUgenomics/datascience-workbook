# Export multiple worksheets as separate text files in Excel

If there are large number of worksheets (tabs) in your excel file that you need to export as a separate text file, follow these guidelines. Note that the worksheet label will be used as file name for the text file with the `.txt` extension.

Before proceeding, check if you have enabled the macros, i.e., if you don't see `DEVELOPER` tab in you empty spreadsheet,  click on `FILE`, `OPTIONS` and `Customize Ribbon`. You should see a check box on the right hand side, for the `DEVELOPER` tab, check it and click `OK`.

Click on `DEVELOPER` and then `Macros`, type in some name (eg. `import_text`), click `create`.

Paste the below code on the popped window:
```
