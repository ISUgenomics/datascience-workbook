# Introduction

## Online hosting of Git repos

Git repositories do NOT have to be hosted on online platforms. Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a Git repository can be stored and managed locally on a single machine or on a network of machines.

However, hosting Git repositories on an online platform such as <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub  ⤴</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab  ⤴</a>, or <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket  ⤴</a> provides several benefits. For example, **hosting your repository on an online platform makes it easier to collaborate with others**, as you can give other people access to your repository and work on it together. Additionally, **online platforms provide a backup** of your repository in case your local machine fails, which helps to ensure that **your content is safe and secure**.

Each platform provides its own set of features and tools for working with Git, and the choice of platform often depends on the specific needs of your project and organization. For example, **GitHub and BitBucket are popular choices for open-source projects**, while GitLab and VSTS are more commonly used for enterprise-level projects.

**Not all repositories in your account need to be public.** It depends on the online platform you use and your account type. <br>
<i>For example, in <b>GitHub</b>, you have the option to make repositories <b>public or private</b>. If you have a free account, you can create unlimited public repositories, but you are limited to a certain number of private repositories. If you have a paid account, you can create unlimited private repositories as well.<br>
Similarly, in <b>GitLab and Bitbucket</b>, you have the option to make repositories public or private. In these platforms, <b>private repositories</b> are usually only available <b>with paid accounts</b>.</i>
