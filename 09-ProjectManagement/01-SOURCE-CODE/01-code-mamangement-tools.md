# Overview

Project management involves a variety of tasks, that help to plan, organize, and manage the resources needed to successfully complete a project. The specific activities involved will vary depending on the nature of the project, the size and complexity of the organization, and other factors. By nformed and targeted managing different aspects of a project, organizations can increase the likelihood of project success and minimize the risk of delays, cost overruns, or other problems.

There are a few key sections of project management:

* **PROJECT PLANNING** <br>
This involves defining the project scope, goals, and objectives, creating a project timeline, and determining the resources required to complete the project. This helps to ensure that the project stays on track, that resources are allocated effectively, and that the project is completed on time and within budget.

* **RESOURCE MANAGEMENT** <br>
This involves allocating the people, materials, and equipment needed to complete the project, as well as managing and tracking the use of these resources.

* **DATA MANAGEMENT** <br>
This involves organizing and storing the data collected during a scientific project, and ensuring that the data is accessible, secure, and well-documented. This is essential for ensuring the reproducibility of scientific results and for maintaining the credibility of the research.

* **VERSION CONTROL** <br>
This is a critical aspect of scientific project management, as it allows scientists to keep track of the changes made to their code or data over time. It helps to ensure that scientists can collaborate effectively, keep their work organized, and maintain the integrity of their research.

* **COLLABORATION & COMMUNICATION** <br>
Scientific projects often involve multiple researchers and institutions, and effective collaboration and communication are key to ensuring the success of the project. This includes using tools such as shared data repositories, wikis, and project management software to keep everyone informed and up-to-date on the project's progress.

* **QUALITY ASSURANCE** <br>
This involves ensuring that the data, code, and methods used in a scientific project meet the highest standards for quality and accuracy. This includes regular code and data reviews, audits, and other quality control measures, which help to minimize the risk of errors and improve the overall quality of the research.

* **PROJECT CLOSING** <br>
This involves finalizing the project and making the data and results accessible to the wider scientific community. This includes publishing the results in peer-reviewed journals or online repositories, ensuring that the data is properly documented, and making it available for long-term access and use. This helps to promote transparency, encourage collaboration, and ensure that the results of the project are accessible to future generations of scientists.


# Version Control

Version control is a system for **managing changes to software projects, documents, or any other set of files**. It provides a history of changes, so you can track who made changes and when, and it allows multiple people to collaborate on a project while ensuring that changes are properly managed and coordinated.

## Popular Tools

In general, <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git  ⤴</a> is considered to be the most popular version control system today, due to its wide adoption, powerful features, and active community of users. There are a few other version control tools available, including <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank">Subversion (SVN)  ⤴</a> and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" target="_blank">Mercurial  ⤴</a>, that are used for managing code and data in software development and other projects.

### *GIT*

<a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git  ⤴</a> is a **distributed version control system**, which means that each user has a full copy of the code repository on their own computer, rather than relying on a central repository. **Git is widely used by software developers and organizations.** This makes it ideal for teams working on large projects or for individuals who need to work offline. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and it has since become one of the most popular version control systems in use today. Git is known for its speed, reliability, and flexibility, and it is used by organizations of all sizes, from small open-source projects to large multinational corporations.

If you are planning to contribute to any GIT-based repository, it is worthwhile for you to learn more about the useful options offered by git. In this case, use the hands-on tutorials that provide **instructions for more advanced git commands**:

## Online hosting of Git repos

Git repositories do NOT have to be hosted on online platforms. Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a Git repository can be stored and managed locally on a single machine or on a network of machines.

However, hosting Git repositories on an online platform such as <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub  ⤴</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab  ⤴</a>, or <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket  ⤴</a> provides several benefits. For example, **hosting your repository on an online platform makes it easier to collaborate with others**, as you can give other people access to your repository and work on it together. Additionally, **online platforms provide a backup** of your repository in case your local machine fails, which helps to ensure that **your content is safe and secure**.

Each platform provides its own set of features and tools for working with Git, and the choice of platform often depends on the specific needs of your project and organization. For example, **GitHub and BitBucket are popular choices for open-source projects**, while GitLab and VSTS are more commonly used for enterprise-level projects.

**Not all repositories in your account need to be public.** It depends on the online platform you use and your account type. <br>
<i>For example, in <b>GitHub</b>, you have the option to make repositories <b>public or private</b>. If you have a free account, you can create unlimited public repositories, but you are limited to a certain number of private repositories. If you have a paid account, you can create unlimited private repositories as well.<br>
Similarly, in <b>GitLab and Bitbucket</b>, you have the option to make repositories public or private. In these platforms, <b>private repositories</b> are usually only available <b>with paid accounts</b>.</i>

### *GitHub*
