# Introduction

In project management, understanding the interplay between <span style="color: #8896c1;">Project Strategy</span>, <span style="color: red;">Project Design</span>, and <span style="color: #0ba37f;">Project Framework</span> is crucial. Each element serves a distinct but complementary purpose. By distinguishing between these three elements, we can better understand their individual contributions to project success.

<table style="text-align: center;">
<tr ><th  style="background: #e8e9e8; color: #3e5a89; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Startegy</th> <th style="background: #fae7e7; color: red; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Design</th><th style="background: #e6f0f0; color: #0ba37f; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Framework</th></tr>
<tr><td>vision and end goals</td> <td>detailed plan to achieve those goals</td> <td>structure, processes, and governance to manage and control the project</td></tr>
<tr><td>ensures that the project has a clear purpose and direction</td> <td>translates this purpose into a detailed, actionable plan</td> <td>provides the necessary structural support to manage and execute the plan effectively</td></tr>
</table>

In professional project management, these elements work together to ensure that a project is well-planned, organized, and executed.

* **What it is?**

<table style="text-align: center;">
<tr ><th  style="background: #e8e9e8; color: #3e5a89; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Startegy</th> <th style="background: #fae7e7; color: red; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Design</th><th style="background: #e6f0f0; color: #0ba37f; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Framework</th></tr>
<tr><td>It's the <b>"why"</b> and the <b>"what"</b>.</td> <td>It's the <b>"how"</b> of the project.</td> <td>It's the the <b>"who"</b> & <b>"when"</b> <br>and <b>"rules of the game"</b>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Project Strategy is the overarching vision and purpose of your project. </td> <td>Project Design is the detailed plan of action.</td> <td>Project Framework is about the structure and governance of the project.</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>Think of it as the <b>compass</b> of your project. It sets the <b>direction and purpose</b>, defining why you're undertaking the project and what you aim to achieve. </td>
  <td>Think of it as the <b>blueprint</b> of your project. It's like a detailed <b>plan or roadmap</b> that outlines what you're going to do and how you're going to do it.</td>
  <td>Consider it the <b>rulebook</b> and scaffolding of your project. It establishes the <b>rules, roles, and structures</b> that guide and support the entire project's execution.</td>

<tr>
  <td>This encompasses the project's <br>- long-term goals, <br>- objectives, <br>- scope analysis, <br>- alignment with broader organizational or academic intentions and <br>- risk management</td>
  <td>It includes <br>- specific goals, <br>- objectives, <br>- deliverables, <br>- timelines, and <br>- resource planning <i>(people, money, equipment)</i>.</td>
  <td>This includes <br>- methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall), <br>- roles and responsibilities, <br>- communication plans, and <br>- processes for monitoring and controlling the project.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
  <td>In a research project, the strategy would encompass <br>- the choice of research area, <br>- the overarching questions or hypotheses, <br>- the significance of the research, <br>- how it aligns with academic or organizational goals, and <br>- how the outcomes will contribute to knowledge or practical applications.</td>
  <td>In a research project, the design would detail <br>- the research methods, <br>- types of data to be collected, <br>- tools and techniques to be used, <br>- the timeline for each phase of the research, and <br>- the expected deliverables.</td>
  <td>In a research project, the framework would establish <br>- the roles and responsibilities of team members and stakeholders, <br>- the communication and reporting protocols, <br>- the procedures for monitoring progress and quality control, <br>- the risk management strategies,
and <br>- the guidelines for decision-making.</td>
</tr>

* **Why it matters?**

<table style="text-align: left;">
<tr ><th  style="background: #e8e9e8; color: #3e5a89; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Startegy</th> <th style="background: #fae7e7; color: red; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Design</th><th style="background: #e6f0f0; color: #0ba37f; width: 312px; text-align: center;">Project Framework</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>The strategy sets the direction for the project, ensuring that it aligns with overarching goals and has a clear purpose. It's like setting the destination before starting a journey.</td>
  <td>Good project design ensures that everyone knows what needs to be done and how. It's essential for turning the strategic vision into actionable steps.</td>
  <td>The framework provides the necessary guidance and structure, akin to the rules of a game. It ensures that all participants understand their roles and that the project remains on track.</td>

<span style="font-weight:800;">NOTE:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">This comprehensive approach is particularly valuable in research projects, where strategic alignment, detailed planning, and robust governance are key to navigating the complexities and uncertainties inherent in research.</span>

<span style="color: #ff3870;font-weight: 500;">Let's delve into how Project Design and Project Framework can be adapted for research projects!</span><br>
*In this tutorial, the focus is on practicality and adaptability, ensuring that the project management practices enhance rather than hinder your research process. The goal is to strike a balance between structured management and the fluid, dynamic nature of research work.*

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;"> Integrating professional project management techniques into the context of small-scale research projects is a great approach to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Itâ€™s a bit less formal, more dynamic, and definitely more focused on the journey of discovery. </span>

# Project Design for Research Projects

## Core Aspects of Project Design

1. **Goals and Objectives** <br>
Clearly define what the research aims to achieve, with a focus on specificity and flexibility.

2. **Deliverables** <br>
Identify expected outcomes such as reports, papers, new hypotheses, or other forms of knowledge dissemination.

3. **Methodology Selection and Development** <br>
Tailor methodologies to best fit the research question or hypothesis, adaptable as new insights arise.

4. **Resource Allocation** <br>
Efficiently manage resources, including funding, materials, knowledge, expertise, and technology.

5. **Timeline and Milestone Planning** <br>
Create a realistic, yet flexible timeline with key milestones, acknowledging the exploratory nature of research.

6. **Decision-Making Processes** <br>
Establish clear, adaptable processes for making decisions in response to evolving project needs.

## Adapting Project Design in Research

1. **Flexibility in Goals, Methodology, and Deliverables** <br>
Be prepared to revise goals, methodologies, and expected deliverables as new data and insights emerge.

2. **Dynamic Resource and Deliverable Management** <br>
Adapt resource allocation and deliverable planning in response to project progression and discoveries.

3. **Adaptive Timeline and Tools** <br>
Utilize tools like Gantt charts or Kanban boards for planning, but be ready to adjust timelines based on research findings.

4. **Iterative Decision-Making** <br>
Implement a decision-making process that can evolve with the project, accommodating new information and challenges.

5. **Integrating Technology Smartly** <br>
Employ technology for data collection, analysis, collaboration, and effective project management.

6. **Handling Uncertainty and Serendipity** <br>
Be equipped to leverage unexpected discoveries and navigate the uncertainties inherent in research projects.
