# Introduction

Project management involves a variety of tasks, that help to plan, organize, and manage the resources needed to successfully complete a project. The specific activities involved will vary depending on the nature of the project, the size and complexity of the organization, and other factors. By informed and targeted managing different aspects of a project, organizations can increase the likelihood of project success and minimize the risk of delays, cost overruns, or other problems.

There are a few key sections of project management:

* **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/00-RESEARCH-PROJECT/03-project-strategy-design" target="_blank">PROJECT PLANNING</a>** <br>
This involves defining the project scope, goals, and objectives, creating a project timeline, and determining the resources required to complete the project. This helps to ensure that the project stays on track, that resources are allocated effectively, and that the project is completed on time and within budget.

* **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/01-COMMUNICATION/00-collaboration-communication" target="_blank">COLLABORATION & COMMUNICATION</a>** <br>
Scientific projects often involve multiple researchers and institutions, and effective collaboration and communication are key to ensuring the success of the project. This includes using tools such as shared data repositories, wikis, and project management software to keep everyone informed and up-to-date on the project's progress.

* **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/02-MANAGEMENT/00-intro-resource-management" target="_blank">RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</a>** <br>
This involves allocating the people, materials, and equipment needed to complete the project, as well as managing and tracking the use of these resources.

* **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/02-MANAGEMENT/01-SOURCE-CODE/01-storage-version-control" target="_blank">VERSION CONTROL</a>** <br>
This is a critical aspect of scientific project management, as it allows scientists to keep track of the changes made to their code or data over time. It helps to ensure that scientists can collaborate effectively, keep their work organized, and maintain the integrity of their research.

  * **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/02-MANAGEMENT/03-DATA/01-data-management" target="_blank">DATA MANAGEMENT</a>** <br>
This involves organizing and storing the data collected during a scientific project, and ensuring that the data is accessible, secure, and well-documented. This is essential for ensuring the reproducibility of scientific results and for maintaining the credibility of the research.

  * **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/02-MANAGEMENT/01-SOURCE-CODE/00-code-developments" target="_blank">CODE MANAGEMENT</a>** <br>
Code management is the process of handling and supervising code development, including version control, code review, and archiving, to ensure consistency, quality, and efficient collaboration in a research project. It doesn't have to be new and complex code; maintaining a detailed record of of how tools are executed, including commands and parameters used in your project is crucial for efficiency and future repeatability.

* **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/02-MANAGEMENT/02-DOCUMENTATION/01-documentation-improvement-tools" target="_blank">DOCUMENTATION</a>** <br>
Effective documentation is vital in research projects as it provides a clear, comprehensive record of methodologies, results, and analyses, facilitating transparency, reproducibility, and ease of knowledge transfer. Tools like Markdown exist to facilitate the creation of user-friendly documentation, making the process more accessible and efficient.

* **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/03-PRODUCTIVITY/00-quality-assurance" target="_blank">QUALITY ASSURANCE</a>** <br>
This involves ensuring that the data, code, and methods used in a scientific project meet the highest standards for quality and accuracy. This includes regular code and data reviews, audits, and other quality control measures, which help to minimize the risk of errors and improve the overall quality of the research.

* **<a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/04-PUBLICATION/01-project-closing" target="_blank">PROJECT CLOSING</a>** <br>
This involves finalizing the project and making the data and results accessible to the wider scientific community. This includes publishing the results in peer-reviewed journals or online repositories, ensuring that the data is properly documented, and making it available for long-term access and use. This helps to promote transparency, encourage collaboration, and ensure that the results of the project are accessible to future generations of scientists.
