# Introduction

<b><a href="https://www.zenhub.com" target="_blank">ZenHub</a> is a project management tool that integrates directly with GitHub.</b> It is popular among teams that heavily use GitHub and are looking for a more powerful project management tool without leaving the GitHub ecosystem. ZenHub provides a suite of features to help teams collaborate, plan projects, and visualize progress.

Some of the notable features and aspects of ZenHub include:

|feature|description|
|-------|-----------|
|**Issues and Epics**|ZenHub enhances GitHub issues with added capabilities. For instance, you can group related issues into "Epics" to represent larger bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller, actionable tasks.|
|**Boards**|ZenHub provides a Kanban-style board that allows teams to visualize and organize their issues and pull requests. This board is similar to tools like Trello or Jira's agile board.|
|**Estimations**|Teams can assign story points or time estimates to issues, allowing for better sprint planning and workload management.|
|**Roadmaps**|ZenHub includes a roadmap feature that helps teams visualize their project milestones and the progress of epics over time.|
|**Reports**|The platform offers various reports, such as velocity tracking, burndown charts, and cumulative flow diagrams, to give teams insights into their performance and progress.|
|**GitHub Integration**|Since ZenHub is built on top of GitHub, it uses GitHub issues and pull requests directly. This means there's no need for a separate syncing process or managing tasks in two places.|

<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
Initially, ZenHub was accessible through browser extensions, which meant that to see the added features on GitHub, team members needed to install the ZenHub extension. However, they've since expanded their offerings, and not all access methods might require this.
