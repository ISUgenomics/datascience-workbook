## 2. Organize Your Research

Efficiently organizing your research activities is not merely a procedural task. It is a fundamental strategy for enhancing productivity and reducing the sensation of perpetually being behind schedule. Proper organization can transform an overwhelming volume of work into manageable, sequential tasks.

### Break Tasks into Manageable Steps

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Divide larger tasks into smaller, actionable steps to make them less daunting. <br>Resist the urge to be a multitasking hero - being a single-tasking legend is where it's at. You’ll get things done faster and better that way.</span>
</div>

Ever looked at your project and thought: "*How on earth am I going to tackle this?*" Yeah, we've all been there. <br>
By chopping it up into bite-sized pieces, you suddenly transform that overwhelming dread into a series of "*Hey, I got this*" moments. <br>
Here’s a quick guide on how to slice up those larger tasks:
- **Identify:** Pinpoint the main components of your task.
- **Break Down:** Divide these components into smaller, actionable steps.
- **Prioritize:** Decide which steps need to happen first.
- **Schedule:** Assign a time and deadline for each step.

**1. Actionable Steps:** ***How to slice and dice your tasks?*** <br>
When you look at a massive task, it's easy to feel like you're staring down a mountain. Breaking it down into smaller steps, you'll feel less overwhelmed and make steady progress. It's all about making the journey more manageable.


| task | break it down | Why it rocks? |
|------|---------------|---------------|
|Literature Review | 1. Identify key themes.<br>2. Search for articles by theme.<br>3. Summarize findings per theme. | Makes a mammoth task feel like a series of quick wins.|
|Data Collection   | 1. Define data needs.<br>2. Design collection methods.<br>3. Pilot test.<br>4. Full-scale collection. | Prevents feeling swamped and spots issues early.|
|Analysis | 1. Clean data.<br>2. Run preliminary analyses.<br>3. Deep dive into complex analyses. | Keeps you from drowning in data and highlights insights step by step.|

**2. Avoid Multitasking:** ***One thing at a time, please!*** <br>
Multitasking might sound like a superpower, but it’s more like trying to juggle while riding a unicycle. While it might feel productive, in reality it can reduce the quality of your work and take more time overall. It’s not as productive as it seems.

Here's why multitasking can trip you up:
- **Decreased Focus:** Switching tasks means your brain can't fully engage with any single one.
- **More Mistakes:** Lack of focus leads to errors, requiring time to fix.
- **Time Loss:** It takes longer to complete tasks because of the constant switching.


### <i><span style="color: #EC8000; ">EXERCISE</span></i>

This exercise is designed to give you hands-on experience with organizing a project and focusing your efforts. By actively engaging in these strategies, you'll develop a better understanding of how to apply them to larger, more complex research projects.

<div style="background: #ffd7b5;  padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">Plan Manageable Steps in Your Project</span>
<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;"><b>Part 1: Break Tasks into Manageable Steps</b><br>
Pick a topic you're interested in, example: "The impact of daily walks on mental health". <br>
Write down the main components of your project. Then, take each main component and divide it into smaller, actionable steps.<br>
Decide which steps need to happen first and assign a rough timeline to each. This helps you see how tasks overlap and what needs immediate attention.
<br><br><b>Part 2: Avoid Multitasking and Focus on One Step at a Time</b><br>
 Using the steps you've outlined, dedicate a set amount of time to work on just one step. <br>Start with 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. (Pomodoro Technique)
<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin: 10px 0;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;"> Before starting, remove potential distractions. This could mean turning off phone notifications, closing unrelated browser tabs, or finding a quiet place to work. </span>
</div>
<b>Part 3: Reflect on Your Performance</b><br> After each work session, take a few minutes to reflect on the experience of focusing on one task.
<li>Did you find it more productive?</li>
<li>What challenges did you face?</li>
<li>How did breaking down the project into smaller steps affect your approach to starting and completing tasks?</li>
<li>How did this exercise change your perception of multitasking and task management in research?</li>
</span>
</div>


### Centralize Information

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Use a central platform where all team members can access necessary information. This reduces the friction of searching for data, references, or resources. </span>
</div>

**Have you ever experienced the frustration of searching for a specific piece of data you are certain you saved, only to find it elusive?** <br>
This common challenge of the endless hunt for files can be efficiently addressed by utilizing a central platform to store your data and documentation. Such a system allows all team members to easily access and deposit necessary information. This approach streamlines the process of information retrieval, significantly reducing the time spent in search of data, references, or results. It’s about making life easier for everyone on the team, so you spend less time searching and more time doing the actual work.

Here's a table comparing the pros and cons of a well-organized and well-documented central repository versus storing files in randomized locations:

| feature | <span style="color: green;">well-organized central repo</span> | <span style="color: red;">randomized storage locations</span> |
|---------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **accessibility** | Easy access for all team members, regardless of location. | Difficult to access information; dependent on individual availability. |
| **collaboration** | Enhances collaboration through shared access and version control. | Collaboration is hindered by lack of visibility and version conflicts. |
| **data integrity** | High integrity with version control and backups. | Risk of data loss, duplication, or corruption. |
| **efficiency** | Saves time by reducing the search for information and data. | Wastes time due to searching across multiple platforms and locations. |
| **security** | Centralized security protocols can be applied, enhancing data safety. | Variable security, with some locations potentially lacking proper safeguards. |
| **documentation** | Consistent, well-annotated documentation improves understanding and reproducibility. | Inconsistent or missing documentation can lead to confusion and errors. |
| **backup and recovery** | Streamlined backup processes; easy to recover lost data. | Complex or nonexistent backup strategies; recovery may be difficult or impossible. |
| **scalability** | Easily scalable to accommodate project growth and additional data. | Scalability is limited and can become increasingly disorganized over time. |
| *example* | <b><span style="color: green;">Good Central Repo Example</span></b>| <b><span style="color: red;">Bad Randomized Data Storage Example</span></b> |
||*A research team used GitHub to centralize their code, documentation, and results for a multi-year data science project. This setup allowed for seamless collaboration across institutions, easy onboarding of new team members, and efficient project tracking, significantly accelerating their research publication timeline.* | *In a hastily organized study, one team stored datasets on various local machines, shared files via email, and kept crucial documentation in paper notes. This disorganization led to lost data when a team member left, delayed analysis due to inaccessible information, and ultimately, a significant setback in their research project's progress.* |

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">NOTE:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">Using a central platform to store all your project information, including data, documentation, and resources, practically ensures that everyone on the team can find what they need without sifting through emails, chat histories, or multiple versions of documents. For instance, <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub  ⤴</a> is fantastic for version control and collaboration on code, while High-Performance Computing <b>(HPC) storage</b> solutions offer robust options for storing large datasets securely.  </span>

<div style="background: mistyrose; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 37px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">WARNING:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">It's essential to foster an inclusive environment where professional development is encouraged but not mandatory, recognizing that team members have diverse life situations and commitments. There should be no pressure or negative consequences for those who are unable to engage in such activities due to personal or professional reasons. </span>
</div>


### Delegate When Possible

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">Don't try to do everything yourself. Delegate tasks that others can do so you can focus on what's most important. The goal is to make your research project a hit, and that means getting the best out of everyone involved.</span>
</div>

Delegating isn’t about offloading work you don’t want to do... It’s about playing to everyone’s strengths. If someone on the team is a wizard with data analysis or has a knack for graphic design, let them shine. It frees up your bandwidth so you can focus on the stuff only you can do, and it empowers your team members by valuing their skills and contributions.

Also, as a team member, make it a practice to seek assistance from colleagues whose skills and experience align with the task at hand. By collaborating and lending support to one another, not only do you expedite task completion, but you also contribute to a culture of teamwork and mutual growth within the team.

**Effective Delegation: Examples and Strategies** <br>
Explore the examples in the table to master effective delegation techniques that match tasks with individual's skills and foster productivity and collaboration within your team.

| Example | Assessment | Explanation |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Assigning a complex data analysis task to a seasoned professional with a background in statistics and analytics. | <span style="color: green;">Good Practice</span> | It matches the task to the team member's skills and expertise. |
| Delegating a design task to a team member who has no prior experience in graphic design. | <span style="color: red;">Bad Practice</span> | It assigns a task without considering the team member's skills, potentially leading to poor-quality outcomes. |
| Clearly outlining the requirements and expectations for creating a project proposal document. | <span style="color: green;">Good Practice</span> | It provides clear instructions, helping the team member understand what is expected of them. |
| Assigning a task without providing any guidance or clarification on what needs to be done. | <span style="color: red;">Bad Practice</span> | It can lead to confusion and misunderstandings, resulting in delays or errors in task completion. |
| Encouraging team members to reach out whenever they need assistance or wish to discuss their progress. | <span style="color: green;">Good Practice</span> | This approach fosters proactive communication and ensures team members feel supported, while tasks stay on track and issues are resolved promptly. |
| Constantly monitoring and requesting updates on delegated tasks throughout the day or week. | <span style="color: red;">Bad Practice</span> | It can create unnecessary pressure and hinder team members' productivity by disrupting their workflow. |
| Recognizing and appreciating team members for completing tasks or achieving project milestones. | <span style="color: green;">Good Practice</span> | It boosts morale and motivation, encouraging team members to continue contributing their best efforts. |
| Attributing success to the entire team regardless of individuals' engagement. | <span style="color: red;">Bad Practice</span> | This can can demotivate genuine contributors who put in extra effort, fostering a sense of injustice and reduced morale.  |
| Engaging all team members with specific taks in key projects to foster a sense of unity. | <span style="color: green;">Good Practice</span> | This promotes a shared sense of accomplishment in flagship projects, enhancing collaboration within the team with an opportunity to celebrate collective success.



### Limit Meetings

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Too many meetings can disrupt your day. Ensure every meeting has a clear purpose, and avoid them if they're not necessary. </span>
</div>

Inefficient meeting practices, such as excessive routine meetings or unnecessary reporting requirements, can drain valuable time and hinder productivity in research projects. Instead, prioritize merit-only meetings that add tangible value to the project's progress. Strategic time management involves discerning between essential collaborations and time-consuming rituals, ensuring every meeting contributes meaningfully to the research objectives.

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Implementing strategies like setting agendas, defining objectives, and keeping meetings concise can help optimize their effectiveness and minimize their impact on your schedule. Organizing daily routine or control meetings with no clear purpose leads to a waste of time, resources and hampers the efficiency of the team. </span>
</div>


**Keep Check-ins for Long-Term Progress** <br>
In long-term research projects, periodic check-ins or meetings are essential for maintaining momentum and ensuring alignment with project objectives. These meetings provide opportunities to track progress, identify potential roadblocks, and make necessary adjustments. To make them effective, these sessions should be structured with agendas or checklists to provide clear outcomes, facilitating actionable steps that propel the project forward with the next short-term goal before the next check-in.

**Are Your Meetings Adding Value?** <br>
The following table delineates between good and bad reasons for scheduling meetings, emphasizing the necessity of purpose-driven discussions while cautioning against habitual or unproductive meeting practices. Hope you find it useful in optimizing your meeting culture and enhancing project efficiency!

| <span style="color: green;">Good Reasons for a Meeting</span> | <span style="color: red;">Bad Reasons for a Meeting</span>  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Asking a peer to troubleshoot the problem you're dealing with. | Scheduling meetings for trivial matters that could be handled individually. |
| Collaborating with colleagues to enhance a specific aspect of common work. | Using meetings as a platform to showcase individual achievements without relevance to the team's goals. |
| Aligning team members on new project objectives. | Routine status updates without substantial progress. |
| Check-ins for Long-Term Progress: <br>Discussing milestones in the next phase of a project. | Calling meetings to share information that could be conveyed via email or other means. |
| Addressing significant roadblocks after a major issue arises. | Conducting meetings to `micromanage` or exert control. |
| Brainstorming solutions to complex issues as they arise. | Holding meetings to assign tasks without clear objectives. |
| Reviewing and refining project strategies after a milestone. | Using meetings as a substitute for individual work. |
| Seeking feedback from team members on project closing. | Gathering for the sake of tradition or habit. |

<span style="font-weight:800;">WARNING:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement/" target="_blank"><b>Micromanagement</b>  ⤴</a> is a management style where a supervisor closely observes or controls the work of their subordinates, often to an excessive degree. This can involve scrutinizing small details, such as closely monitoring work processes or nitpicking minor errors. It may also include requiring frequent progress reports through various means such as meetings, messages or spreadsheets, to ensure constant oversight. Additionally, not trusting employees to work autonomously is also a sign of micromanagement through behaviors like checking email drafts or requiring to be cc'd or taking back delegated work. This can lead to decreased morale, reduced productivity, increased stress levels and hindered creativity among team members. </span>
</div>

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">If you work with experienced, conscientious and professional people consider blending the Results-Only Work Environment (<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/agx0aqn/managing-in-a-results-only-work-environment" target="_blank">ROWE  ⤴</a>) approach with a <a href="https://blog.idonethis.com/trust-verify-management-tool/" target="_blank">"trust but verify"  ⤴</a> mindset. Provide employees with autonomy to manage their schedules and tasks while maintaining open channels for feedback and support when needed. This allows for a balance between autonomy and accountability, ensuring alignment with goals while promoting trust and a supportive work environment. </span>
</div>


### Effective Collaboration

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Foster effective collaboration by establishing clear communication channels and encouraging open dialogue among team members. </span>
</div>

In research projects, effective collaboration is essential for breakthrough and success.
- By promoting transparent communication, sharing ideas, and leveraging each team member's strengths, you can harness the collective intelligence of your group to achieve common goals efficiently.
- By actively involving your collaborating peers in decision-making processes, you highlight their roles within the project, fostering a sense of commitment and accountability.
- By encouraging individual team members to build collaborative relations with external experts, you expand the collective network and access valuable resources.

Embrace collaboration as a cornerstone of your research process, allowing for diverse perspectives and innovative solutions to emerge.

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Keeping in touch through communication platforms and respecting defined roles and responsibilities are key elements in fostering a collaborative research environment that promotes productivity and innovation.</span>
