# Introduction

In the context of research, effective **resource management** is crucial as it directly **influences the quality, timeline, and costs of research**, ultimately determining the success of the project. By optimizing resource utilization, research teams can avoid overuse or waste of resources, address bottlenecks promptly, and **enhance productivity and innovation**.
