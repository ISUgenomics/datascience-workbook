# Why use Markdown?

<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown ⤴</a> is a text-based mark-up language that is easily rendered into HTML and PDF. Markdown is widely used in various platforms, including GitHub, Jupyter Lab, Visual Studio Code (VSC), and Atom, making it an essential tool for developers, writers, and anyone who wants to create well-formatted and easily readable documents.


## Reasons for using Markdown:

* **Simplicity**: Markdown uses a straightforward syntax that is easy to learn and use. It employs a combination of plain text and simple formatting elements, such as headers, lists, emphasis, and links, allowing you to focus on your content without being overwhelmed by complex markup tags.

* **Portability**: Markdown files are plain text files with a .md or .markdown extension, which means they can be opened and read in any text editor. This portability ensures that your documents can be easily accessed and edited across different platforms and devices without losing formatting.

* **Readability**: Markdown's syntax is designed to be highly readable, both in its raw form and rendered output. The syntax closely resembles plain text, making it intuitive to write and understand. Additionally, the rendered output maintains a clean and uncluttered appearance, making it ideal for presenting information in a clear and organized manner.


### Some additional reasons for using Markdown:

* It has become a staple of reproducible science
* it can be rendered on <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/01-SOURCE-CODE/04-intro-to-github" target="_blank">GitHub ⤴</a> (also Bitbucket & GitLab) and makes online repositories more readable and accessible
* it is used as a notebook interface for R (<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Rmarkdown ⤴</a>)
* it is used as the markup language for <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/04-DevelopmentEnvironment/01B-jupyter-basics" target="_blank"> Jupyter notebooks ⤴</a>, which provide a notebook interface for many languages, including Python and R
* There are some freely available editors that make writing in Markdown pretty easy

    * Windows and Linux: [Github ATOM](https://atom.io/) and [REMARKABLE](https://remarkableapp.github.io/)
    * Mac OSX: [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
    * [Remark](https://remarkjs.com) for markdown powerpoint like slides

# Getting started with the Markdown syntax 

Start with the Mastering Markdown guide by github located here:

* <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank"> Mastering Markdown Guide ⤴</a>
* The file extension for a Markdown file is `.md`
* Also check this guide about <a href="https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown#content-classes" target="_blank"> Generating Slides with Markdown ⤴</a>



## Where to use Markdown?

Content that can be practically useful:

* **README.md**: Markdown is commonly used to create README.md files in software repositories. A well-written README file can provide essential information about a project, including installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.

* **Documentation**: Markdown is an excellent choice for creating technical documentation, tutorials, and user guides. This workbook is written using Markdown!

* **Blogging**: Many platforms and content management systems support Markdown for writing blog posts. With Markdown, you can quickly draft and publish articles without dealing with the complexities of HTML formatting.

* **Note-taking**: Markdown's lightweight nature and portability make it an ideal format for taking notes. You can use Markdown in note-taking apps or plain text editors to create organized and easily searchable notes. 


## Plugins 
Various text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) provide Markdown plugins to enhance your Markdown editing experience. Here are some popular ones:

* <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/01-SOURCE-CODE/04-intro-to-github" target="_blank">**GitHub** ⤴</a> has built-in Markdown rendering, so you can simply create or edit Markdown files directly in your repositories. GitHub also provides a Markdown preview option to view the rendered output.

* <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/04-DevelopmentEnvironment/01B-jupyter-basics" target="_blank"> **Jupyter notebooks** ⤴</a> a popular environment for data science and interactive computing, supports Markdown cells. You can write Markdown text alongside code in Jupyter notebooks to create comprehensive and well-documented reports.

* <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/04-DevelopmentEnvironment/01A-tutorial-VSCode" target="_blank"> **Visual Studio Code** ⤴</a> and Atom: Both VSCode and Atom offer Markdown preview extensions that allow you to visualize the rendered Markdown output side by side with the raw Markdown file. These plugins provide live previews, syntax highlighting, and additional features to streamline your Markdown editing.
