# Introduction

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a text-based mark-up language that is easily rendered into HTML and PDF.

Here are some of the top reason for using Markdown besides its format interchangability.

* It has become a staple of reproducible science:
* it can be rendered on GitHub (also Bitbucket & GitLab) and makes online repositories more readable and accessible
* it is used as a notebook interface for R ([Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/))
* it is used as the markup language for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks, which provide a notebook interface for many languages, including Python and R
* There are some freely available editors that make writing in Markdown pretty easy

    * Windows and Linux: [Github ATOM](https://atom.io/) and [REMARKABLE](https://remarkableapp.github.io/)
    * Mac OSX: [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
    * [Remark](https://remarkjs.com) for markdown powerpoint like slides
