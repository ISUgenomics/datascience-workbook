# Introduction

Creating infographics, particularly those related to scientific applications, can be a challenging task. The good news is, there are numerous web-based tools with ready-made templates available that can make this job easier. Scientists, researchers, and educators across various disciplines can now leverage these tools to create diagrams, infographics, and graphical abstracts that can effectively communicate their research or teachings.

<span style="color: #ff3870;font-weight: 500;">Most online tools generally require an account creation</span> to enable features like saving your work, accessing templates, and exporting your final product. This is largely due to the nature of these tools and the services they offer, as they often need to store user data and project progress. <br>
However, there are **some tools that can be downloaded and used offline** without creating an account. For instance, software like:

* <a href="http://www.cellillustrator.com/" target="_blank">Cell Illustrator  ⤴</a> is a tool that enables biologists to create, visualize and simulate `genetic` regulatory and `biochemical` reaction networks.
* <a href="https://cytoscape.org/" target="_blank">Cytoscape  ⤴</a> is a free open-source software for visualizing `complex networks` and integrating these with any type of attribute data.
* <a href="https://pathvisio.github.io/" target="_blank">PathVisio  ⤴</a> is a free open-source pathway analysis and drawing software for drawing, editing, and analyzing `biological pathways`.
* <a href="https://www.perkinelmer.com/product/chemdraw-professional-chemdrawpro" target="_blank">ChemDraw  ⤴</a> is a leading `chemical` drawing tool used by chemists and biochemists.
* <a href="https://www.gplates.org/" target="_blank">GPlates  ⤴</a> is a plate tectonics tool for interactive cutting-edge `geoscience` research and visualization.
