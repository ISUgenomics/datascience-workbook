# Introduction

Vector graphics are digital **images composed of mathematical equations** that define shapes, lines, and curves. Unlike raster graphics, which are made up of pixels, vector graphics **can be scaled infinitely** without losing quality. Vector images retain their sharpness and clarity at any size. They are commonly applied in various fields such as graphic design, logo creation, illustration, web design, architectural drafting, and print media, where precise and scalable artwork is required.

### Advantages of vector graphics over raster graphics

Vector graphics offer scalability, easy editing, and small file sizes, making them ideal for projects that require resizing, flexibility, and efficient storage. However, they can be challenging for highly detailed and photorealistic images, and may require more processing power for rendering complex artwork.

| PROS | CONS |
|------|------|
|`Photo Editing and Manipulation` <br>Vector graphics are **resolution-independent**, meaning they can be scaled up or down without any loss of quality. This makes them ideal for projects that require artwork in various sizes, such as logos, illustrations, and print materials.    |`Complexity for Photorealistic Images` <br>Vector graphics are not well-suited for highly detailed and photorealistic images. Since they are based on mathematical equations, creating intricate textures, gradients, and realistic effects can be challenging. |
|`Editability` <br>Vector graphics are composed of individual objects and mathematical equations that define their properties. This allows for **easy editing and modification of shapes, colors, and other attributes**. It also enables efficient workflow and flexibility when making changes to the artwork.    |`Limited Representation of Continuous Tones` <br>Vector graphics are inherently composed of solid colors and well-defined shapes. They struggle to represent continuous tonal variations found in photographs or highly detailed images.|
|`Small File Sizes` <br>Vector graphics typically have smaller file sizes compared to raster graphics. Since vector graphics store information mathematically, they only need to record the equations and properties of the objects, resulting in **compact file sizes**.
