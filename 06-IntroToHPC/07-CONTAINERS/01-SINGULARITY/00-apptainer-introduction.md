# Introduction

<b><a href="https://apptainer.org" target="_blank">Apptainer  ⤴</a></b> is, in fact, the evolution and rebranding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(software)" target="_blank">Singularity  ⤴</a>. In late 2021, the decision was made to reflect a broader mission and vision for the project. While <b>Singularity originated as a container solution for HPC</b>, it has since grown to serve more use cases beyond just HPC, including Edge and IoT (Internet of Things) Computing, Enterprise IT and Cloud, Data Mobility and Reproducibility. So now, <b>Apptainer aims to serve a broader audience by addressing the needs of various computing environments and scenarios beyond just HPC.</b>

## Apptainer as container technology

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">NOTE:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
Containers, like Apptainer, address the challenge of installing and configuring custom software in the user space of Unix systems, HPC in particular, where regular user does not have root privileges. <br><br>
Containers are lightweight, standalone units designed to package software, its dependencies, and runtime environment into a single entity, ensuring consistent behavior across diverse systems. <br><br> Apptainer, formerly known as Singularity, offers unique advantages tailored for high-performance computing and scientific workflows.
</span>
</div><br>

Apptainer <i>(previously Singularity)</i> offers some features that make it distinct from other container technologies like Docker, such as:
* run complex applications on HPC clusters
* ability to run containers without root privileges
* seamless compatibility with specialized HPC configurations
* focus on security, reproducibility, and portability
* open-source project

## Apptainer on a local machine

Follow the guide provided in section <a href="https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/quick_start.html#quick-start" target="_blank">Quick Start</a> in the official Apptainer Documenattion, which is intended for running Apptainer on a computer where you will install Apptainer yourself.

If you want to use the Apptainer on the HPC infrastructure, see [next section](#apptainer-on-the-HPC-clusters).

## Apptainer on the HPC clusters

Apptainer provides a streamlined solution for running containers in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, offering compatibility, security, and efficiency. Regular users can easily deploy, manage, and execute applications encapsulated in custom containers, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across complex computational environments.

### Load Apptainer module
Apptainer is usually preconfigured by HPC administrators, allowing regular users to activate and utilize it simply by loading the corresponding module. To check if the Apptainer module is available on an HPC system, users can typically use the command:
```
module avail apptainer
```
to list available modules and search for Apptainer in the output:

![06_apptainer_module.png](../../assets/images/06_apptainer_module.png)

Users should choose the specific version of the Apptainer module they wish to work with, and activate it by loading the module using the command:
```
module load apptainer/<version>         # e.g., module load apptainer/1.1.9-py310-wsbt4ge
```

Once the desired Apptainer module version is loaded, users can then directly execute `apptainer` commands and manage their containers within the HPC environment.

### Apptainer temporary files
In the context of jobs in HPC environments, **controlling the cache location** can be crucial to ensure that jobs do not run out of space or hit quotas during execution. By setting the cache directory paths, users can:
* optimize performance by placing the cache on a fast filesystem
* and manage storage by avoiding directories with space constraints (such as `home`).

The `APPTAINER_CACHEDIR` and `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` are environment variables that determine where Apptainer (formerly Singularity) caches its temporary files during operations like image builds or container pulls.

|variable|description|
|----|----|
|`SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`| This environment variable was used in Singularity versions to specify the directory where Singularity should cache images and layers during operations. Setting this variable allows users to control the caching location, especially useful in HPC environments where home directories might have quota limits. |
|`APPTAINER_CACHEDIR`| Given the rebranding from Singularity to Apptainer, it's logical to infer that this environment variable serves a similar purpose for Apptainer as SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR did for Singularity. |

If a user doesn't manually set these variables and there's no default set by the admin, **the Apptainer will use its own default caching location, which is typically in the user's home directory** or a temporary directory. By default, without setting `$APPTAINER_CACHEDIR`, Apptainer might use a directory like `~/.apptainer` (in the user's home directory) for its cache, similar to how Singularity used `~/.singularity` by default.

**Move `.apptainer` dir outside `home` location** <br>
You can relocate the `.apptainer` directory from your `home` to a location without storage limits *(e.g., /project path on SCINet clusters)*, and then create a symbolic link in your `home` pointing to the new location, ensuring that the cache remains accessible from the `home` directory without additional modifications.

<i>For example, at Atlas or Ceres (SCINet clusters), you can do:</i>
```
cd ~
mkdir /project/<your_project_dir>/<account_name>
mv .apptainer /project/<your_project_dir>/<account_name>/
chmod -R g+s /project/<your_project_dir>/<account_name>/.apptainer
ln -s /project/<your_project_dir>/<account_name>/.apptainer .apptainer
```

<div style="background: mistyrose; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">WARNING:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
HPC admins might set default values for these variables to optimize system-wide performance or to prevent users from filling up specific filesystems with cache data. These defaults can be set in global configuration files or through module environments. When an admin sets these, users on the system will typically inherit these values automatically unless they override them.
</span>
</div>

In practice, it's always a good idea for users to check whether these variables are set by default on their HPC system and to be aware of how to set them if needed.

**Check the current value** <br>
To see what is currently set for these environment variables, you can use the `echo` command:
```
echo $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR
```

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
Individual users can override the default settings by specifying their own values for these environment variables in their session or job scripts. This can be useful if a user has a specific directory they want to use for caching or if they're encountering space issues with the default cache location.
</span>
</div>

If you've set `$APPTAINER_CACHEDIR` to a custom location, that directory will be used for caching instead of the default `~/.apptainer`. However, if `$APPTAINER_CACHEDIR` points directly to `~/.apptainer`, then they are functionally the same.

**Set the value in a current session** <br>
Before running any Apptainer or Singularity command, you can export the desired cache directory by setting the environment variable in your shell or within a job script. *For example:*
```
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/path/to/custom/cache
```
**Permanent Setting** <br>
If you find yourself frequently setting these variables, you can add the `export` command to your shell's startup scripts (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`) to set them automatically whenever you start a new session.

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
Remember that setting these variables will direct Apptainer or Singularity to use the specified directory for caching. Make sure the path you provide has enough space, especially if you're pulling large images or frequently building containers. It's also wise to periodically clean up old cache files to free up space using the command <b>apptainer cache clean</b>.
</span>
</div>

## Apptainer Commands

Apptainer *(formerly Singularity)* provides a variety of commands to manage and interact with containers.

<div style="background: mistyrose; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">WARNING:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
<b>With the rebranding from Singularity to Apptainer</b>, the command-line keyword changed from "singularity" to "apptainer." However, the structure and many of the <b>options and arguments for the commands remained consistent</b>, allowing for a familiar experience for those who had previously used Singularity.
