# Large Scale Storage (LSS)
The LSS is a storage service for Iowa State faculty and staff. It is useful for research labs that need to store large amounts of data including sequencing data, images, and other large files. 

## Access
Space on LSS can be requested from https://lss.apps.it.iastate.edu/

Once you have purchased space on LSS, folders can be mounted to your computer directly. Check out this guide on <a href="https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/guides/lss/mount_folders/" target="_blank">how to mount folders from LSS</a>.
