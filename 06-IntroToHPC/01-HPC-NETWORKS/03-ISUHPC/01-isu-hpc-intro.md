# HPC Clusters at ISU
**High Performance Computing** (HPC) refers to a cluster of interconnected computers or servers used to perform complex computational tasks. HPC clusters can process large amounts of data in a short time and can handle large computationally intensive jobs. General information about HPC clusters available at Iowa State University can be found at the <a href="https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">ISU HPC Website ⤴</a>. <br>

**Components of HPC Clusters at ISU**
* **headnode** or **login node** - used to log in, submit jobs, and view output
* **data transfer node** - used for data transfers
* **compute nodes** - different types including regular, fat, GPU, etc. are used for computations
* **Infiniband switch** - connects all nodes


## Research Clusters
* **Condo Computing Cluster** - Free access cluster
* **Nova Computing Cluster** - Faculty can purchase nodes and storage on this cluster


## Education Cluster
* **HPC Class** - These are partitions on Nova cluster dedicated to class use
  * Check the <a href="https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/nova/hpc-class" target="_blank">Guide to HPC Class ⤴</a> from ISU for more details


## Storage
* **Large Scale Storage** - Storage service for ISU researchers
<br>
<br>

# Logging in
To log in to Nova/Condo Clusters, you need to be connected to ISU network on-campus or use <a href="https://vpn.iastate.edu/+CSCOE+/logon.html#form_title_text" target="_blank">ISU VPN ⤴</a> if you are off-campus. The first time you try to log in to Nova or Condo, a new Google Authenticator (GA) account is created. You will need to use GA for login. The first time you use the <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/06-IntroToHPC/02-SSH/01-secure-shell-connection" target="_blank">Secure Shell ⤴</a> connection to Nova/Condo, it will respond with:

```
"host key not found, generate hostkey?(yes/no)"
```

You need to answer yes to continue.

# Best Practices: Tips

* Test your code/job on a small scale before submitting it to the cluster, if possible. This can help save time and resources as submitting a job often takes longer due to queue times and uses more resources. For example, you can use interactive nodes to find and fix errors before submitting a job.
* Make sure your script is optimized for the cluster such that it uses the available resources efficiently.
* Use proper documentation and version control such as Git to track changes and ease of reproducibility. 
* Manage your files appropriately on the cluster. Cleaning up unnecessary files and organising data/files is important.
