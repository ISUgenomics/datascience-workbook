# Introduction

# Submitting dependency jobs using SLURM

SLURM scheduler uses `sbatch` command to submit the jobs. You can submit large number of jobs using a loop or if you want to run a series of jobs that runs after completion of set of jobs using the same command. You can also schedule the job to start running on a predefined time as well. In this tutorial, we will explain how to submit jobs that runs depending on status of the previously submitted jobs or schedule a bunch of jobs to run one after the other.

To understand the dependency feature take a look at the `-d, --dependency` section in the `man` page of the `sbatch` command


Once you submit a job, using that job ID, you can submit dependency jobs. For eg.
```
sbatch first_job.slurm
```
You will get the job id
```
854.computername
```
Next, you can submit a job that only runs after successful completion of the first job as follows:
```
sbatch --dependency=afterok:854 second_job.slurm
```

The format here is
```
sbatch --dependency=type:job_id jobfile
```

If the job requires more than one job to be completed before it is executed, you can supply all the jobids using `,` separator
```
sbatch --dependency=type:job_id,job_id,job_id jobfile
```

You can also set the job to run if any one of the job ids compltes successfully using a `?` separator
```
sbatch --dependency=type:job_id?job_id?job_id jobfile
```

The other dependencies that can be used for`<type:job_id>` are as follows:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| after | This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have begun execution |
| afterany | This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated. |
| aftercorr | A task of this job array can begin execution after the corresponding task ID in the specified job has completed successfully |
| afternotok | This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated in some failed state |
| afterok | This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully executed |
| singleton | This job can begin execution after any previously launched jobs sharing the same job name and user have terminated |
