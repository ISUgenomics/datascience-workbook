# Introduction

Jupyter Lab is an **interactive web-based tool** that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text (e.g., documentation), offering benefits such as data exploration, reproducibility, and collaboration.

In Jupyter notebook, users can leverage various Python libraries, including graphical ones, to analyze and visualize data **all in one document**, providing a powerful and efficient environment for Python-based developments. It offers a convenient way to organize and document a project, making it easier to share and collaborate with others.

Notebooks can be easily shared as a `.ipynb` file or hosted on online platforms (e.g., <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab  ⤴</a>), **allowing collaborators to access and modify the same document in real-time**, which streamlines collaboration and helps to reduce errors and redundancies.


## *Is Python in Jupyter always good?*

**YES**, Jupyter is a powerful modern interactive development environment!

However, while Python coding in Jupyter offers many advantages, **it may not always be the best choice for every project or use case**.

<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #66cb5e; ">✓</span> Jupyter notebook `.ipynb` is primarily designed for interactive computing, data exploration, and rapid prototyping, making it an excellent tool for tasks like data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #df0010; ">✗</span> For **small Python scripts**, a plain text file script `.py` is often sufficient and may be more appropriate than a Jupyter notebook `.ipynb`.
* Plain text files are lightweight, easy to read, and can be executed directly from the command line, which makes them a suitable choice for simple scripts.

* Additionally, plain text files are easier to version control with tools like Git, which can be essential for collaborating and managing code changes.

<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #df0010; ">✗</span> For **production-level Python code**, where performance, scalability, and maintainability are critical, other tools may be more suitable. It's important to consider the specific requirements of the project and choose the appropriate development environment accordingly.

<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #df0010; ">✗</span> For **large modular Python developments**, IDEs such as Visual Studio Code (VSC) or PyCharm are often a better choice than Jupyter, since they offer more advanced features, like debugging, refactoring, and testing, that are essential for professional development.

# Python in *try-jupyter* **online** <br> *scatterplot using matplotlib*

The Jupyter Project offers an **online training platform** called <i>"Try Jupyter"</i> that allows users to **get started with Python projects in Jupyter** without having to install any software on their own computer.

The <a href="https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/" target="_blank">Try Jupyter ⤴</a> online coding platform provides Python kernel with the <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Pyodide  ⤴</a> distribution.

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">NOTE:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
<b>Pyodide is a Python runtime environment that runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly</b>. It includes the Python interpreter, standard library <i>(<a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/wasm-constraints.html" target="_blank">limited modules only  ⤴</a>)</i>, and a number of third-party libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pillow, and <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html" target="_blank">more  ⤴</a>), all of which can be used directly <b>in the browser without requiring any installation</b> or setup. Pyodide was developed by Mozilla and is part of the larger WebAssembly project.
</span>
</div><br>

**PROS & CONS** <br>
<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #66cb5e; ">✓</span> A good option to quickly see if working in JupyterLab is for you. <br>
<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #66cb5e; ">✓</span> You don't even need to install Jupyter Lab, all you need is an Internet connection. <br>
<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #66cb5e; ">✓</span> Most useful libraries are available without additional installation. <br>
<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #df0010; ">✗</span> You can't install custom libraries. <br>
<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #df0010; ">✗</span> You can't easily load files from your local file system <i>(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server#running_a_simple_local_http_server" target="_blank">running a simple local HTTP server  ⤴</a> is required)</i> <br>
<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #df0010; ">✗</span> You can't easily load data files and images from online resources. <br>

**Here's how you can use the platform:**

**1.** Open any web browser and go to the Try Jupyter website: <a href="https://jupyter.org/try" target="_blank">https://jupyter.org/try  ⤴</a>

**2.** Click on the `Try` button in the top menu bar and then click on the `Try JupyterLab` section, to launch the Jupyter user interface in your browser.

![02_python-jupyter-try-online.png](assets/images/02_python-jupyter-try-online.png)

*Wait for the platform to load. This may take a few moments.*

**3.** Once the platform has loaded, you should be redirected to the URL: <a href="https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/" target="_blank">https://jupyter.org/<b>try-jupyter</b>/lab/  ⤴</a>. Now, you can start a new notebook:
* using the Launcher shortcuts by clicking on the `Python (Pyodide)` button in the **Notebook** section

or
* using the top menu bar: `File : New : Notebook ` and selecting `Python (Pyodide)` from the drop-down menu.

![02_python-jupyter-try-notebook.png](assets/images/02_python-jupyter-try-notebook.png)

*The new notebook should appear as a new tab in your JupyterLab interface.*

**4.** You can rename the notebook file by double clicking on the filename in the `File browser` panel on the left-hand side. *My notebook is called `scatterplot.ipynb`.*

![02_python-jupyter-try-notebook-file.png](assets/images/02_python-jupyter-try-notebook-file.png)

You can now start writing Python code in the notebook cells and running them by clicking on the `Run` button in the top menu bar or pressing `Shift + Enter`.

**5. Example Python-based notebook for creating scatterplot using matplotlib.**

<i>In this example, we create the set of 100 random 3-dimensional points using `numpy` library. Then we will use a `matplotlib` functions to plot the dataset as a 2-dimensional scatterplot with a third dimension determining the size of the points.</i>

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">NOTE:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
<a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy  ⤴</a> is a Python library for numerical computing that includes a <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html" target="_blank">random  ⤴</a> module for generating random numbers and arrays. <br><br>
<a href="https://matplotlib.org" target="_blank">Matplotlib  ⤴</a> is a popular data visualization library for Python. It provides a wide range of tools for creating different types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.
</span>
</div><br>

Both libraries are included within the Pyodide distribution, so no installations are required.

**STEP A:** Create a markdown cell in the notebook providing the introduction to your project.

*You can copy the text provided below and paste it into the first cell in the notebook.*

<div style="background: #e8e9e8; padding: 15px;">
# Python-based ScatterPlot <br>
In this project, we will explore the use of: <br>
* `matplotlib`, a Python data visualization library, to create a scatterplot <br>
* `random` module of the `numpy` library, to generate a dataset for plotting, composed of 100 3-dimensional points. <br><br>

*Through this exercise, we aim to showcase the potential of these powerful tools in effectively representing and visualizing complex data sets. By leveraging the capabilities of Matplotlib and Numpy, we hope to provide insights into the relationships and patterns that can be inferred from the given dataset.*
</div><br>

Now, change the cell type from `code` to `markdown` in the top menu bar in the notebook section.

![02_python-jupyter-try-notebook-cell.png](assets/images/02_python-jupyter-try-notebook-cell.png)

<div style="background: #cff4fc; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
To learn more about Markdown syntax and benefits, check out the practical tutorial <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/02-DOCUMENTATION/02-intro-to-markdown" target="_blank">Introduction to Markdown  ⤴</a> in Section <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/09-ProjectManagement/02-DOCUMENTATION/01-documentation-improvement-tools" target="_blank">09.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to enhance your skills!
</span>
</div><br>

To execute the cell press `Alt + Enter` ( use `option + return` for macOS ). <br>
*This will render the markdown content and add a new cell below. By default, new cells are always of the `code` type.*

In the next cell add Python code for all required imports, i.e., `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

```
# import modules
import numpy as np                        # to generate random dataset
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt      # to create scatterplot
```

![02_python-jupyter-try-notebook-code.png](assets/images/02_python-jupyter-try-notebook-code.png)

To execute the code cell, again press `Alt + Enter` ( use `option + return` for macOS ).

In the next `code cell` add Python code for generating the dataset and creating the scatterplot.

```
# Generate 100 random data points along 3 dimensions
x, y, scale = np.random.randn(3, 100)

# Create a scatter plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add dataset to the scatterplot
ax.scatter(x=x, y=y, c=scale, s=np.abs(scale)*500)

# Add labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X Label')
ax.set_ylabel('Y Label')
ax.set(title="Some random data, created with JupyterLab!")

# Show the scatterplot
plt.show()
```

To execute the code cell, again press `Alt + Enter` ( use `option + return` for macOS ).
