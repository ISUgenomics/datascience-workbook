## 1. Installing PyCharm

**You have two options to choose from when installing PyCharm:** <br>
&emsp; **A.** the Toolbox App, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#toolbox" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#toolbox  ⤴</a> <br>
&emsp; **B.** a standalone installation, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone  ⤴</a>

**The Toolbox App** is a unified installer that can be used to install, manage, and update **multiple JetBrains IDEs, including PyCharm**. It provides a centralized location to manage all of your JetBrains tools and provides easy access to all the installed tools. With the Toolbox App, you can easily update all your JetBrains IDEs from a single interface and install new IDEs with just a few clicks.

**A standalone installation** of PyCharm involves downloading and running a **separate installer for your operating system**. With a standalone installation, you have more control over the installation process and can customize which components of PyCharm to install and where to install them. Standalone installations are also a good option if you need to perform advanced installation tasks.

## Creating Project

When you use PyCharm for the first time, the "Projects" section in the general options will be fairly basic. The main options that you will see include **creating** a new project, **opening** an existing project or **downloading a project** from a version control system (VCS) repository such as Git, Subversion, or Mercurial.

![02_python-pycharm-project.png](assets/images/02_python-pycharm-project.png)

**If you choose to create a new project**, you will be able to specify a Python the project name and location, select virtual environment, and automatically create the `main.py` Python script file.

![02_python-pycharm-project.png](assets/images/02_python-pycharm-project-create.png)

Once you create a new project in PyCharm, you will be taken to the project interface, which includes several key components:

* Toolbar (1)
* Project panel (2)
* Editor panel (3)
* Navigator Bar (4)
* Console Panel (5)
* Status bar (6)


![02_python-pycharm-project.png](assets/images/02_python-pycharm-project-options.png)

**Toolbar**

The toolbar *(1, blue box)* is located at the top of the PyCharm window, and contains various buttons and icons that allow you to perform common actions, such as running your code, debugging your code, and navigating to different parts of your project.

**Project panel**

Project panel *(2, pink box)* is typically located on the left side of the PyCharm window. You can toggle it on and off by clicking the "Project" button in the left-hand toolbar. Within the Project pane, you can navigate through your project's directories and files. You can expand and collapse the various nodes, and select individual files to edit.

**Editor panel**

Editor panel *(3, pink box)* is typically located in the center of the PyCharm window. When you open a file in the project pane, it will be displayed in the editor pane. You can open additional tabs in the editor pane by double-clicking on files in the project pane, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + N` *(replace "Ctrl" with "cmd" on macOS)*.<br>
*By default, PyCharm opens the main file for your project (e.g. "main.py" for a Python project) in the editor pane.*

**Navigator Bar**

Navigator Bar *(4, blue box)* is located at the top of the editor pane, and displays the path to the currently open file. Using the dropdown menu *(folded under three vertically-stacked dots in the top-right corner)*, you can quickly navigate to different files in your project or bookmark open tabs. Above, there is an additional menu bar, allowing you to quickly `run` or `debug` the currently opened file or `search` for classes, files, tools, actions, and settings.

**Console Panel**

Console Panel *(5, blue box)* The console pane is typically located at the bottom of the PyCharm window, directly below the editor pane. When you run your code, the output will be displayed in the console pane. If you can NOT see the console section in your project view, it is probably collapsed and you can expand it by clicking the "Console" button in the bottom toolbar. There are also other options available such as *Terminal*, *Problems* detected, *Services*, or *Version Control* that can be showed as separate panels in the project view.

**Status bar**

Status bar *(6, yellow arrow)* is located at the bottom of the PyCharm window. It displays information about your project and the current state of PyCharm. You can customize the information that is displayed in the status bar by right-clicking on it and selecting displayed parameters.
