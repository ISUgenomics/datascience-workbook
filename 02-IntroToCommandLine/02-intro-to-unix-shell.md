# Introduction


## What is Unix?
* Multiuser operating system
* Linux: free version of this type of operating system
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, and CentOS
* Used on high-end workstations, database servers, web servers and managing shared resources
* Standard features include: Security, reliability, scalability
  * Can supports 100s of users at a time


## Can I learn Unix?

* **Yes!** Absolutely. It is just another way of operating your computer
* No more difficult than learning Word, Excel or Powerpoint
* Biggest difference
  * In Linux:  You type the command to execute
  * In Windows and Mac: You use your mouse to execute a command

`Remember!` **In the Terminal, “Don’t use the mouse.”**

## 1.1 Unix Shell Terminology

|*TERM*|*DEFINITION*|*NOTES*|
|-------|------|-------|
|**filename**| the name of a file |  In Unix it is better to not include spaces in names for directories. <br>The underscore "_" can be used to replace any spaces you might want. |
|**path**| location in the file system | |
|**alias**| the shortcut for a more complex set of commands| aliases can be defined in the **.bashrc** file |


## 1.2 Unix Shell Variables

For getting more information about the environment, you can type `env`, which lists all the variables currently set. If you want to know specifically about a variable, you can do:

```
echo $VARIABLE
```
Some variables that are useful are:

| *VARIABLE* | *DEFINITION*                       |
