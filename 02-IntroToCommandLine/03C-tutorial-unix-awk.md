Awk can be a powerful general-purpose scripting language to perform advanced text processing. 


It is mostly used as a reporting and analysis tool.

```
$ cat > marksheet.txt
Allan Lamb 78
Graeme Hick 56
David Gower 83

Graham Gooch 43
```
Enter Ctrl-C to return to the `$` terminal prompt.
```
$ cat marksheet.txt
Allan Lamb 78
Graeme Hick 56
David Gower 83

Graham Gooch 43
```
### `cat`-like (Default) behavior of Awk:
```
$ awk '{print}' marksheet.txt
Allan Lamb 78
Graeme Hick 56
David Gower 83

Graham Gooch 43
```

The file marksheet.txt has five lines including and empty line. Each line is a __record__. Each __record__ is split into fields (separated by whitespace character, which is the default behavior). Each field can be accessed by the __$__ sign followed by a number denoting the field. In the example below, each __record__ has three words separated by a single space character. We can access the first and third fields of the file by,
```
$ awk '{print $1,$3}' marksheet.txt
Allan 78
Graeme 56
David 83

Graham 43
```
The first field (First name) and the third field (Marks scored) are returned. The empty line is also returned as it is also a __record__.

### `grep`-like Awk
```
$ awk '/G/ {print}' marksheet.txt
Graeme Hick 56
David Gower 83
Graham Gooch 43
```
There are three records with the letter G. Now if we needed all Gs in the beginning of a record or line, then we might do:
```
awk '/^G/ {print}' marksheet.txt
Graeme Hick 56
Graham Gooch 43
```
There are just two records in this case.

### Doing Arithmetic
Let us get the average marks scored by the candidates. For that we do:
```
$ awk '{sum+=$3} END {print sum}' marksheet.txt
260
```
We can get the average scores by:
```
$ awk '{sum+=$3} END {print sum/NR}' marksheet.txt
52
```
There are a couple of things to notice. One, the introduction of a new variable NR; and two, the output is incorrect. The average should be 65 and not 52. The NR command stores the number of current records, which in our example is five, including the empty line and thus explains the error in the output. To remove the empty line:

```
awk NF marksheet.txt > marksheet2.txt
```
The NF variable contains the number of fields in a line and is positive when the line is non-empty and prints it. Awk does nothing when the line is empty.


```
cat marksheet2.txt
```

### output
```
Allan Lamb 78
Graeme Hick 56
David Gower 83
Graham Gooch 43
```
Now,
```
awk '{sum+=$3} END {print sum/NR}' marksheet2.txt
```

### output
```
65
```

Sometimes the field separator could be a tab character. So, when we do

```
$ awk 'OFS="," {print $1, $2, $3}' marksheet2.txt > marksheet3.csv
```
we use OFS to set the output field separator to be a tab character. Looking at marksheet3.tsv, where tsv is tab separated value,

```
cat marksheet3.csv
Allan,Lamb,78
Graeme,Hick,56
David,Gower,83
Graham,Gooch,43
```
So, doing

```
$ awk '{print $1}' marksheet3.csv
$ 
```
returns no output. That is because the default separator is a blank space. To set the field separator on the command line,

```
$ awk -F ',' '{print $1}' marksheet3.csv
Allan
Graeme
David
Graham
```

### Built-In Variables In Awk

FS: FS command contains the field separator character which is used to divide fields on the input line. The default is “white space”, meaning space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character (typically in BEGIN) to change the field separator.

RS: RS command stores the current record separator character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a newline.

OFS: OFS command stores the output field separator, which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a blank space. Whenever print has several parameters separated with commas, it will print the value of OFS in between each parameter.

ORS: ORS command stores the output record separator, which separates the output lines when Awk prints them. The default is a newline character. print automatically outputs the contents of ORS at the end of whatever it is given to print.
