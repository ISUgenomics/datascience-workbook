# *Text Files editors in the Terminal*

|| ||
|--|--|--|
| <span style="color:Green">_Command_</span>|<span style="color:Green">_Function_</span>|<span style="color:Green">_Syntax/example usage_</span> |
|`nano`	|edit file	|`nano` <span style="color:Red">FILENAME</span>|
|`vim` | edit a file | `vim` <span style="color:Red">FILENAME</span>

#### nano -- Text editor more like a GUI

Nano opens up and will feel like a typical text editor you are familiar with.  Arrow keys can be used navigate the text. Below are some additional shortcuts.

|NANO SHORTCUTS| |
|--|--|
| <span style="color:Green">_Command_</span>|<span style="color:Green">_Function_</span>|
|`ctrl+o`	|save file|
|`ctrl+x`	|close file|
|`alt+/`	|go to end of the file|
|`ctrl+a`	|go to start of the line|
|`ctrl+e`	|go to end of the line|
|`ctrl+c`	|show line number|
|`ctrl+_`	|go to line number |
|`ctrl+w`	|find matching word|
|`alt+w`	|find next match|
|`ctrl+\`	|find and replace|

#### <span style="color:Green">Exercise:</span>

Copy and paste the following text into a file named myFirstfile.txt
```
The greatest challenge is sifting through all the data that is generated by the
simulation.  In fact, it is impossible.  Impossible because to record every
event everywhere in the artificial universe would take more hard drive space
than was physically possible to create given Earth's dwindling resources.
Therefore, my life's greatest achievement was to encode a method to filter the
data, so only the most relevant events related to what we want is recorded. In
our case, that means space travel.  But not just any space travel, space travel
between galaxies.
```

Start by copying the text above using your mouse then in a terminal use nano to create a file named myFirstfile.txt

```
nano myFirstfile.txt
```
Paste your text and then hit `ctr x` press `y` for yes to save and hit `enter`, which will return you to the prompt.  This will save the file with the text in it.

#### VIM

`vim` is another text editor that when you are more comfortable with the unix command line, it will be worth your time to learn.  Many first time Unix users type in `vim` to enter the editor and get stuck in the editor as it is less intuitive than nano.  I will not go into great detail in this introductory tutorial but want to provide you with resources to explore on your own. There is a command line like feature in this editor that a user can use to execute very powerful text editing functions.

|Vim | Very Basics Usage|
| -- | -- |
|esc| Hitting escape will take you back to the original state when you opened vim.|
|i| insert mode: In this mode it is possible to add/edit the text |
|esc :wq| hitting escape then typing `:` `w` `q` will write(save) the file and quit|

Copying and pasting work like other editors as long as you are in the insert mode.
