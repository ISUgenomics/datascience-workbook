## Computational Science & Data Science

Computational Science and Data Science are two fields that often intersect to provide the best solution for the challenging problem. Overall, **computational science** tends to focus more on **using computer simulations** to study and understand scientific phenomena, while **data science** tends to focus more on **using data** to extract insights and make predictions. Both fields require strong skills in programming, statistics, and problem-solving.
