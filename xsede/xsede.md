# Introduction to XSEDE

## What is XSEDE?

The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded collection of supercomputers and high-end visualization and data analysis resources. XSEDE resources are an order of magnitude more powerful than most University's local super computer.

For more information about XSEDE this [XSEDE Pamphlet](https://www.xsede.org/documents/10157/169907/what-is-XSEDE.pdf) provides an excellent overview.


## Who is Eligible.
Researchers or educators at a U.S.-based institution, including federal research labs or commercial organizations are eligible to apply to be a PI for an allocation of compute time and storage.  This includes postdoctoral researchers. PIs can give students accounts to use the allocation.

## How do I get an account?

There is a ```Create an Account``` button on the [XSEDE User Portal (XUP)](https://portal.xsede.org/#/guest) or you can go directly to this page through this link: [Create an Account](https://portal.xsede.org/?p_p_id=58&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&saveLastPath=0&_58_struts_action=%2Flogin%2Fcreate_account)

## How do I get an Allocation?

Once you have created your account, log in and go to the allocations tab and click on the ```Submit/review Request``` sub-tab.

If this is your first time using XSEDE, I would recommend a Startup Allocation request.  The requests are short and have a quick turn around time to get you started with a small but decent allocation to get started.  Startup Allocations are very useful to get performance and coding information that will be needed in a full research allocatoin request.

#### Examples


* [XSEDE Example 1](https://portal.xsede.org/documents/10308/29438/Successful+Startup+Request1.pdf)
* [XSEDE Example 2](https://portal.xsede.org/documents/10308/29438/Successful+Startup+Request2.pdf)

## Research Allocation

Once you are more familiar with XSEDE through your Startup allocation and have some performance and coding metrics you can apply for a Research Allocation to meet your computing needs. This is also done in the XUP ``` allocations tab/ Submit/review Request``` sub-tab.  More information on the requirements for the allocation request including formatting and required documentation can be found in their [Research Allocation Documentation](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research)

## Getting started on Bridges

If you decide to use bridges resources then you will need to create a separate login and password. See the following documentation for more information
