  definition: "is an isolated workspace created to manage and run specific projects without affecting the system's global settings. It allows developers to install and use different versions of software packages and dependencies tailored to a project. Example <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_environment_software' target='_blank'>virtual environment software</a> includes `virtualenv`, `venv` and `conda` for managing environments and Python packages. These tools help ensure project consistency and prevent conflicts between dependencies in different projects."
- name: "virtual-machine"
  wiki: "Virtual_machine"
  definition: "is a software emulation of a physical computer, providing the functionality of a real computer system. It runs on a host system and uses virtualized hardware resources to operate an independent operating system (OS) and applications. Virtual machines are commonly used for testing software, running multiple OS environments on a single physical machine, and enhancing security through isolation. Tools like VMware, VirtualBox and Microsoft Hyper-V are popular for creating and managing virtual machines. In High-Performance Computing (HPC) and cloud environments, virtual machines enable efficient resource utilization, scalability and flexibility by allowing multiple virtual instances to run on shared physical infrastructure."
- name: "visualization"
  wiki: "Data_and_information_visualization"
  definition: "is a highly visually influential and semantically meaningful form of modern communication methods. In Data Science, interactive graphing and creating concise infographics support both the ease of extracting insights and the opportunity for deeper analysis for those interested. That contributes to better knowledge retention."
- name: "volcano-plot"
  wiki: "Volcano_plot_(statistics)"
  definition: "is a scatter plot that displays statistical significance of the change (y-axis, typically -log10 p-value) versus magnitude of change between two conditions (x-axis, typically log2 fold-change) for large-scale datasets. It is commonly used in bioinformatics and molecular biology to visualize differential expression of genes or proteins between two conditions. For example, in RNA-seq experiments, a volcano plot helps identify genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated, aiding in the discovery of potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets."
# W
- name: "web-server"
  wiki: "Web_server"
  definition: "is a system that delivers web content to users over the internet. It processes incoming requests from clients (typically web browsers), retrieves the requested resources such as HTML pages, images, and scripts and sends them back to the clients. Web servers can host websites, handle web applications and manage data exchange. Data can be retrieved from online web servers using various methods, such as HTTPS requests, command-line tools like wget and curl, APIs for structured data exchange and web scraping techniques for extracting information from web pages."
- name: "wget"
  wiki: "Wget"
  definition: "is a command-line utility used for downloading files from the internet. It supports protocols like HTTP, HTTPS and FTP, enabling users to retrieve content from web servers. Wget is especially useful for batch downloads, recursive downloading (to fetch entire websites) and resuming interrupted downloads. Its versatility and robustness make it a popular tool for automating file retrieval tasks, web scraping, and mirroring websites. Wget operates non-interactively, meaning it can run in the background and handle complex download tasks without user intervention, making it ideal for scripts and scheduled tasks."
- name: "widgets"
  wiki: "Graphical_widget"
  definition: "are interactive elements in graphical user interfaces (GUI) that allow users to interact with applications. In the context of web development, widgets can include buttons, sliders, text boxes and other controls that facilitate user interaction. They are essential for creating user-friendly and dynamic web applications. Libraries such as Dash in Python enable developers to build complex, interactive web applications with custom widgets. Dash, in particular, is designed for data visualization and analytics applications, providing a range of pre-built widgets for creating responsive and interactive user interfaces. Widgets enhance the usability and functionality of web applications by providing intuitive controls for users."
- name: "windows"
  wiki: "Microsoft_Windows"
  definition: "is a widely-used operating system developed by Microsoft, known for its graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with their computers using visual elements like windows, icons, and menus. It supports a broad range of applications and is popular in both personal and business computing environments. Windows includes features such as a taskbar, Start menu, file explorer and system settings, making it user-friendly and accessible. It also supports multitasking, networking, security features and extensive hardware compatibility."
- name: "workdir"
  wiki: "Working_directory"
  definition: "is a working directory for a project or computational task. It often appears as a variable or instruction that can be assigned a path to a selected location in the file system. That path is then used for all future commands that require a location, such as writing to a file. It is a common variable for workload managers on distributed computing infrastructures. The pathname of the current working directory can be accessed with the `pwd` command or using the `$PWD` environmental variable."
- name: "workload-manager"
  wiki: "Workload_Manager"
  definition: "is a system that efficiently allocates and manages computing resources for running various tasks and jobs on HPC clusters. It schedules, monitors and optimizes the execution of workloads, ensuring that resources are used effectively and jobs are completed in a timely manner. Workload managers handle job queuing, prioritization and resource allocation, balancing the load across available nodes to maximize throughput and minimize wait times. Examples of workload managers include SLURM, PBS (Portable Batch System) and LSF (Load Sharing Facility). These tools are crucial for maintaining the performance and efficiency of HPC environments, enabling researchers and engineers to run complex simulations and analyses smoothly."
# Y
- name: "yum-list-all"
  wiki: "Yum_(software)"
  definition: "(Yellowdog Updater, Modified) is a package management utility for RPM-based Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Fedora, common on HPC systems. YUM simplifies the process of installing, updating and removing software packages, resolving dependencies automatically to ensure that all required packages are installed. It retrieves packages from configured repositories and can manage package groups for easier software deployment. <base class='mb'> The command **yum list all** provides a comprehensive list of all available packages in the configured repositories, including those that are installed and those that are available for installation. This command is useful for users who need to see the full range of software options and versions available on their system."
# Z
- name: "zipping-files"
  wiki: "ZIP_(file_format)"
  definition: "is the process of compressing one or more files into a single archive file, typically with a `.zip` extension. This reduces the total file size, making it easier to store and transfer. Zipping files preserves the directory structure and can also include additional metadata. Common tools for zipping files include software like WinZip, 7-Zip, and the built-in zip utilities in operating systems like Windows, macOS and Linux. In addition to saving space, zipping files can also facilitate the packaging of multiple files into a single, manageable unit for easier distribution and organization."
