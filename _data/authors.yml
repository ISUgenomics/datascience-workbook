  bio         : "His PhD was in Biophysics/NMR spectroscopy.  He did a Bioinformatics Postdoc in Soybean genetics and now runs the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University.  He is passionate about evolution and the science behind the genome. There is so much we don't know about how the elements in a genome interact to create the fine balance of gene expression, modification and 3D structure that create the dynamic range of phenotypes we observe.  As sequencing technology continues to improve and the cost continues to decrease, we will be able to ask more complex questions that increase our understanding via comparative and translational genomics.

  name        : "Arun Seetharam"
  bio         : "My main interests are in the fields of bioinformatics and evolutionary genomics. Currently, I am working on various projects involving next-generation sequencing including the first de novo assembly of a teosinte genome. I am also developing pipelines to streamline the assembly and annotation process for newly sequenced organisms. My long-term goal is to study the genome organization and evolution of grass species."
