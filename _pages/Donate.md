# How to Donate

If you found this page, you may be looking for a way to show your appreciation to the main developers of the bioinformatics workbook. My team and I work very hard to keep this resource up to date and free for all users.  If you have found the bioinformatics workbook helpful consider making a donation to ensure its continued success.   Give what you feel it was worth to you or contribute the cost of a coffee and I will take them all out.

Only the top portion needs to be filled out, up to designations.  Then click on the next button at the bottom of the page.
