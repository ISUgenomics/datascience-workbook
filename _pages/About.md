# Data Science Workbook

The Data Science Workbook is an essential resource for any modern scientist. Whether you're just starting out in data science or are an experienced professional, this workbook has something for you.

It provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of data science, covering the basics of background knowledge and good practices, as well as state-of-the-art tools and methods. The workbook also includes **hands-on tutorials** and examples of **real-world applications**.

The workbook is organized in a way that is accessible to beginners, with sections on **Computer Science** (*Command-Line, Computer Setup, Development Environment, Programming, High-Performance Computing*), **Data Processing** (*Data Acquisition, Wrangling, and Visualization*), and **Project Management**. More experienced users can quickly find the information they need by using the **[Index](sitemap.md)** and **[Glossary](glossary.md)**. 

This workbook provides a solid foundation in data science principles that are universal across disciplines. For information on more advanced techniques specific to a particular field, such as *Bioinformatics*, *Geospatial analysis*, or *Artificial intelligence*, we recommend checking out our other [Workbooks](https://101workbook.org).


## Preface

With the rapid advancement of computer technology in the early 21st century, humanity has shifted from an analog world to a digital one. This has greatly expanded the capabilities of collecting, parsing, transferring, and storing data. In today's world, digital data dominates, with a [2013 study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm) [�](a "ScienceDaily: Big Data, for better or worse: 90% of world's data generated over last two years. May 22, 2013") showing that over 90% of the world's data was created in the previous two years. In [2020](https://now.northropgrumman.com/zipping-past-the-zettabyte-era-whats-next-for-the-internet/), the volume of created data reached a staggering 64 zettabytes, and the trend continues to grow exponentially [�](a "https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/ : Volume of data created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide from 2010 to 2025. March 18, 2022"). With such vast amounts of information, both structured [�](a "Structured Data is highly-organized, has a standardized format, well-defined structure, follows a persistent order, and is easily accessed by humans and programs.") and unstructured [�](a "Unstructured Data has no predefined format or organization, making it much more difficult to process using conventional data tools and methods. Most of data is unstructured."), there is a need for efficient computational tools to find patterns, filter by key, and categorize data in order to extract knowledge and insights. This is where **Data Science** comes in.


## What is Data Science?

Data Science is a cutting-edge approach to efficiently processing large amounts of digital data for data mining and discovering new knowledge. Regardless of the source (*healthcare, social media, bioinformatics, logistics, finance, cybersecurity*), **Big Data** has become its own entity because of its size and **unstructured** nature. This presents various technical challenges at all stages of the **data lifecycle** [�](a "Classification according to Berkely School of Information. https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/what-is-data-science-2/"), including capturing, maintaining, processing, analyzing, and communicating. Data Science focuses on solving these problems and developing unique techniques for digital data, such as **Machine Learning**. This interdisciplinary field incorporates the latest advancements in *computer and information science*, supported by *mathematics* and *statistics*. It also requires specific **domain knowledge** to ask relevant research questions and set boundaries for analysis. When it comes to **extracting knowledge** from data, the goal of Data Science is to present the results in an attractive and meaningful way, using high-tech components like data integration and **interactive visualization**. As the size of the project and amount of data increases, **project management** becomes a crucial part of Data Science, ensuring reproducibility, standardization, and **knowledge retention**.
