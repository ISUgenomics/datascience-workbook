is a set of rules in problem-solving operations. Creating algorithms is a foundation of programming, where a developer defines a finite sequence of well-defined instructions to perform computations and process data. Among the typical elements of an algorithm, regardless of programming language, are conditionals and loops that enable repetitive actions and logical decisions.

The queue is ordered by wait time, user priority, and availability of requested resources. When the combination of these factors is advantageous, the submitted task begins executing, and so its status changes from waiting to running. The queuing system is typical for distributed computing, such as a network of computer clusters shared by more users. Some of the most popular workload managers are SLURM and PBS.

<span style="color: #24376b;">
is highly organized in terms of easy digital deciphering. That includes a standardized format, enduring order, and categorization in a well-determined arrangement that facilitates managing and querying datasets in various combinations. A typical example of an organized data structure is a spreadsheet or relational database.

## U

<span style="color: #518cc2; font-weight:bold">Unix Shell</span> -
<span style="color: #24376b;">
is a command-line interpreter that provides a command-line user interface for a computer's operating system (OS). The OS uses shell scripts/commands to control the execution of the programs and procedures.

<span style="color: #518cc2; font-weight:bold">Unstructured Data</span> -
<span style="color: #24376b;">
has no organized structure that can be easily detected, processed, and categorized by computer algorithms. This type of data is usually massive and descriptive in nature. A good example is the streams of highly varied text (e.g., emails, social media posts, online blogs, newspapers, books, and scientific publications), audio and video recording, images and photos, data from various sensors (weather, traffic), and medical records.

<span style="color: #24376b;">
is a highly visually influential and semantically meaningful form of modern communication methods. In Data Science, interactive graphing and creating concise infographics support both the ease of extracting insights and the opportunity for deeper analysis for those interested. That contributes to better knowledge retention.

<span style="color: #518cc2; font-weight:bold">Workdir</span> -
<span style="color: #24376b;">
is a working directory for a project or computational task. It often appears as a variable or instruction that can be assigned a path to a selected location in the file system. That path is then used for all future commands that require a location, such as writing to a file. It is a common variable for workload managers on distributed computing infrastructures. The pathname of the current working directory can be accessed with the 'pwd' command or using the '$PWD' environmental variable.
