## A

<span style="color: #518cc2; font-weight:bold">Algorithm</span> -
<span style="color: #24376b;">
is a set of rules in problem-solving operations. Creating algorithms is a foundation of programming, where a developer defines a finite sequence of well-defined instructions to perform computations and process data. Among the typical elements of an algorithm, regardless of programming language, are conditionals and loops that enable repetitive actions and logical decisions.

## E

<span style="color: #518cc2; font-weight:bold">Environment</span> -
<span style="color: #24376b;">
_development environment_, is a workspace for developers where they create and modify the source code of their application (software, web, etc.). Nowadays, professional developers usually use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is a software suite partially with a graphical interface to make various things easier for the programmer (general code management, tracking and pushing changes, file system browsing, file preview & editing, kernel loading, autocomplete, formatting, etc.);<br>_programming environment_, is a layer of settings specific for a given programming language or type of developed application. It can be isolated from the general operating system and provides a kind of _virtual environment_ with adjusted software configuration or modules loaded in a selected release. Virtual environments are commonly used when programming in Python and can be easily created using Conda ( environment management system).

<span style="color: #24376b;">
is the organization of data retained in the digital storage on the computing machine. The content consists of hierarchically ordered folders and files. Folders are user-categorized containers for files. Files contain data and consume digital storage space. Some files belong to the operating system and include configurations, source code, and executables of various programs. Each file and folder is assigned an absolute path that defines its location in the file system. Knowing this path is very useful for navigating the file system from the command line.

<span style="color: #24376b;">
_OS_, is the core software on the computer that manages computing resources, performes installations, and executes available programs. Command-line interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) enable the user directly interact with the operating system to set up, configure, and troubleshoot it. Among the popular operating systems are Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

## P

<span style="color: #518cc2; font-weight:bold">Programming</span> -
<span style="color: #24376b;">
means creating a set of instructions for a computer on how to execute operations in order, following the assumptions and logical conditions of the algorithm. Many programming languages facilitate communication between the code developer and the computing machine. Bash enables a shell scripting using a command-line interpreter for automating repetitive tasks by executing pre-defined commands according to requested conditionals and loops. More advanced analytical operations, including mathematical and statistical functions, modifying complex data structures, or processing non-text data, usually require a higher-level programming language such as Python or C++.

## Q

<span style="color: #518cc2; font-weight:bold">Queue</span> -
<span style="color: #24376b;">
in distributed computing, it is an organized list (sequence) of tasks submitted to the job scheduler that manages the computational resources and decides to start or stop the task. The queue is ordered by wait time, user priority, and availability of requested resources. When the combination of these factors is advantageous, the submitted task begins executing, and so its status changes from waiting to running. The queuing system is typical for distributed computing, such as a network of computer clusters shared by more users. Some of the most popular workload managers are SLURM and PBS.

<span style="color: #518cc2; font-weight:bold">Remote Machine</span> -
<span style="color: #24376b;">
is any other computer or computing network that the user can access by logging into the external network. Performing actions on a remote machine requires a secure login and often requires the user to have an account created by the network administrator. In scientific projects, we use remote computing machines as part of the HPC infrastructure to access high-performance computing and collaboratively share big data.

<span style="color: #24376b;">
is a working directory for a project or computational task. It often appears as a variable or instruction that can be assigned a path to a selected location in the file system. That path is then used for all future commands that require a location, such as writing to a file. It is a common variable for workload managers on distributed computing infrastructures. The pathname of the current working directory can be accessed with the 'pwd' command or using the '$PWD' environmental variable.
