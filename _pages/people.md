### Arun S. Seetharam

![Arun](../assets/images/people/Arun.jpg){: .align-left}
My main interests are in the fields of bioinformatics and evolutionary genomics. Currently, I am working on various projects involving next-generation sequencing including the first de novo assembly of a teosinte genome. I am also developing pipelines to streamline the assembly and annotation process for newly sequenced organisms. My long-term goal is to study the genome organization and evolution of grass species.
