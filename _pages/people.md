I am a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I have been programming since 2006 and have an interest in data visualization and software development. My research focus has been on analyzing and merging networks, monitoring the evolution of influenza A viruses in swine, and writing cross-platform pipelines. In 2020, I joined the Genomics Informatics Facility in the hopes of developing interdisciplinary pipelines and tutorials.

### Arun S. Seetharam

![Arun](../assets/images/people/Arun.jpg){: .align-left}
My main interests are in the fields of Bioinformatics and evolutionary Genomics. Currently, I am working on various projects involving next-generation sequencing, including the first *de novo* assembly of a teosinte genome. I am also developing pipelines to streamline the assembly and annotation process for newly sequenced organisms. My long-term goal is to study genome organization and the evolution of grass species.
