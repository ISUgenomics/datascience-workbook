# Introduction

<button class="btn note mr"></button><em class="c-good">This tutorial has been upgraded to incorporate Python-based automation approach, suplementing the foundational guide on Excel macros originally created by Arun Seetharam.</em>

**TASK or CHALLENGE:**

If you have a large number of worksheets (tabs) in your Excel file that you need to export as separate text files, this tutorial will guide you through automating the process, making it quicker and reducing the risk of errors.

### Export multiple worksheets as separate text files in Excel

Handling and distributing data spread across multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially when each worksheet needs to be exported as a separate text file.<br>
<em class="cons"></em> Manually saving each worksheet individually is not only laborious but also prone to errors. <br>
<em class="pros"></em> This tutorial offers a <span class="c-good">detailed guide to automate the export process</span>.

*By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to export a large number of worksheets from Excel efficiently, with each worksheet saved as a separate text file and labeled as the worksheet name.*


## **A. Create macro in Excel** (Windows and macOS)

### <button class="btn required mr">Excel Settings</button>

<div class="required before" data-before="" markdown="1">
1. **Microsoft Excel:** Before you begin, ensure you have `macros` enabled in your Excel tool.

    <details class="l-frame" markdown="1"><summary class="c-header"><b>Windows:</b></summary>

    1. **Open Excel:** Start Excel and open a new, empty workbook.
    2. **Access Excel Options:**
    * Click on the **File** tab in the top-left corner.
    * From the menu, select **Options**. This will open the Excel Options dialog box.
    3. **Customize Ribbon:**
    * In the Excel Options dialog box, click on **Customize Ribbon** from the list on the left.
    * On the right side, you'll see a list of the main tabs. Look for the **Developer** checkbox.
    * Check the box next to **Developer**.
    4. **Apply and Close:** Click `OK` to apply the changes and close the Excel Options dialog box. <br>
    The Developer tab should now be visible in the Excel ribbon.
    </details>

    <details class="l-frame" markdown="1"><summary class="c-header"><b>macOS:</b></summary>

    1. **Open Excel:** Start Excel and open a new, empty workbook.
    2. **Access Preferences:**
    * Click on **Excel** in the menu bar at the top of the screen.
    * Select **Preferences** from the dropdown menu.
    ![]({{ images_path }}/excel_developer_tab.png)
    3. **Ribbon & Toolbar:**
    * In the **Excel Preferences** dialog box, click on **Ribbon & Toolbar**. *(see an image in the next step)*
    4. **Customize Ribbon:**
    * In the Customize Ribbon section, youâ€™ll see a list of tabs. Look for the **Developer** checkbox.
    * Check the box next to **Developer**.
    ![]({{ images_path }}/excel_developer_tab_check.png)
    5. **Apply and Close:** Close the Ribbon & Toolbar preferences dialog box.
    ![]({{ images_path }}/excel_developer_tab_activated.png)
    6. **Enable Full Disk Access for Excel** To ensure that Excel macros work correctly and can manage inputs and outputs on macOS, you need to grant Excel full disk access.
      * Open `System Preferences`.
      * Go to `Security & Privacy`.
      * Click the `Privacy` tab.
      * In the left sidebar, select `Full Disk Access`.
      * Click the lock icon in the bottom left corner and enter your password to make changes.
      * Click the `+` button and add the **Microsoft Excel** application to the list.
    </details>

2. **Excel Spreadsheets:** An Excel workbook containing multiple worksheets (tabs) that you want to export. <br>
    Each worksheet should contain structured data in a consistent format. *The VBA code for the macro can be adjusted to handle different data formats appropriately.*
</div>


### *1. Prepare your Excel spreadsheets*

You can use any Excel file that contains at least 2 spreadsheets to complete this exercise. If you followed the <a class="t-links" href="721.2"></a> tutorial, you can use the final <a class="t-links" href="721.2" section="#3-run-the-script">output.xlsx</a> file or you can simply <a href="/07-wrangling/assets/data/excel_macros/output.xlsx" download="output.xlsx"><button class="btn" type="button">DOWNLOAD it here</button></a>. *You should get an Excel file with 5 worksheets.*
![the preview of the output Excel file]({{ images_path }}/excel_python_txt_import_output.png)


### *2. Add VBA code of the macro*

1. Open Excel app (graphical user interface).
2. Click on `Developer` tab in the Excel wirndow and then `Macros` button.
3. In the pop-up window, type in some name for a new macro (e.g., `export_text`) and click `create` or `+` (on macOS). The new pop-up window with `Microsoft Visual Basic` will appear.
    ![]({{ images_path }}/excel_add_macro.png)
4. **MS Visual Basic window:** Paste the below code in the `Code` panel on the right:

### *3. Run the macro*

**Excel spreadsheet:** Go back to your Excel spreadsheet window.

Click on `Macros` again. This time, the pop-up `Macro` window (1) has a list of your added macros. Select the one you've just created. Then, click the `Run` button.
![]({{ images_path }}/excel_run_macro_export.png)
(2) A window should pop up asking the preffered delimiter. In the next one (3) you should select the location to save exported files. <base class="mb">
Each spreadsheet will be exported to an individual file. It might take a while to complete, if there are large number of spreadsheets, so be patient.
![]({{ images_path }}/excel_export_results.png)


## **B. Python-based automation**

This section will walk you through the process of **using** `Python` **to automate the export of multiple Excel spreadsheets into separate files**. <br>
<em class="pros"></em> This approach will save you time and reduce the risk of errors compared to manual data entry. <br>
<em class="pros"></em> It is a universal, cross-platform solution (Windows, macOS, Linux). <br>
<em class="pros"></em> It is a command-line solution (Python script executed in the terminal window).

### <button class="btn required mr">Tools and Settings</button>

<div class="required before" data-before="" markdown="1">
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1. **Microsoft Excel:** It is not required for you to have MS Excel installed; you only need the `.xlsx` spreadsheet file.
2. **Python:** This tutorial uses `Python` to automate the process. <br>
    Ensure you have <a class="t-links" href="423" section="#which-installation-on-my-operating-system">Python installed</a>. You can download it from <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">python.org</a>. <br>
    If you are starting your Python adventure from scratch, it is worthwhile to develop your skills gradually strengthening them over time. In that case, itâ€™s best to follow this tutorial in order.
    * <a class="t-links" href="531" section="#1-learn-python-basics-using-online-platform">Learn Python basics using online platform</a>
    * <a class="t-links" href="531" section="#2-get-python-locally-and-start-coding-in-the-ide">Get Python locally and start coding in the IDE</a>
3. **Libraries:** You will need the following Python libraries:
    * `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis. <button class="btn more before" data-before="LEARN MORE"></button> *...from the <a class="t-links" href="536">tutorial</a> in this workbook*
    * `openpyxl`: For Excel file operations. <button class="btn more before" data-before="LEARN MORE"></button> *...from the <a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">documentation</a>*
    <base class="mb">
    You can install these libraries using `pip` *(once you have Python installed)*:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas openpyxl
    ```
4. **Output Text Files:** Select a folder where you want to save the exported text files. <br>
    The files can be in any text format such as `.txt`, `.tsv`, `.csv`, etc., and you can select any character as **a unified delimiter**. Common options include: `,` , ` ` , `;` , `|`. *The Python script can be adjusted to handle these different file formats and delimeters.*
</div>


### *1. Write the Python script*

Create a new Python script (e.g., `export_worksheets_to_files.py`). In terminal you can use the following command:
```bash
touch export_worksheets_to_files.py
```
Open this script in your preferred <a class="t-links" href="400">development environment</a> (e.g., <a class="t-links" href="411">VSC</a> or Atom) or simple <a class="t-links" href="322">code editor in terminal</a> (e.g., `nano` or `vim`).
```bash
nano import_txt_to_excel.py
```

Then, follow the steps below to write all sections of the script.

1. **Import Necessary Libraries** <br>
    First, import the necessary libraries:
    ```python
import os
from openpyxl import load_workbook
    ```

2. **Set the variables (paths and output delimiter)** <br>
    Set the path to the directory containing your text files and the expected location for outputs:
    ```python
input_file = 'path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx'   # Adjust path for the input Excel file
output_path = 'path_to_output_directory'      # Adjust output directory path
    ```
    Set the delimiter used in your input files:
    ```python
sep= ','                                      # Change this to the desired delimiter
    ```
    <div class="protip" markdown="1">
    **Delimiter:** Adjust the `sep` parameter to separate data in your output text files (e.g., comma, tab, semicolon). It is used in the next part of the script in the `f.write()` method.
    </div>
    Set the extension of your text files:
    ```python
ext = '.txt'                                 # Adjust extension of output text files
    ```

3. **Create Function: Sanitize Filename Function** <br>
    This function removes any invalid characters from the sheet names to ensure valid filenames.
    ```python
def sanitize_filename(filename):
    invalid_chars = '<>:"/\\|?*'
    for char in invalid_chars:
        filename = filename.replace(char, '')
    return filename
    ```

4. **Create Function: Export Sheets to Text Files** <br>
    This function loads the Excel workbook, iterates through each worksheet, and writes the content to a text file using the specified delimiter. The output directory is created if it does not exist.
    ```python
def export_sheets_to_text(excel_path, output_dir, delimiter=',', format='.txt'):
    workbook = load_workbook(excel_path, data_only=True)
    if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
        os.makedirs(output_dir)

    for sheet in workbook.sheetnames:
        ws = workbook[sheet]
        output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, sanitize_filename(sheet) + format)

        with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            for row in ws.iter_rows(values_only=True):
                row_data = [str(cell) if cell is not None else '' for cell in row]
                f.write(delimiter.join(row_data) + '\n')

        print(f'Sheet "{sheet}" has been exported to {output_file}')
    ```

5. **Main Script Execution** <br>
    This section runs the `export_sheets_to_text` function with the specified inputs when the script is executed.
    ```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    export_sheets_to_text(input_file, output_path, sep, ext)
    ```
