Information is the foundation of the learning process. Data acquisition and wrangling are crucial parts of Data Science that lead to extracting knowledge from the information. With large, difficult to transfer data, remote access is the rule, almost exclusively via a command-line interface. Luckily for you, knowing a few tricks make it easy to access and visualize data in a friendly way on a remote machine. As you explore this section, you will also learn how to manage Excel spreadsheets and efficiently manipulate massive data with Python.
