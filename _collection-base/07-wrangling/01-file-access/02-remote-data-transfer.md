# Introduction

Remote data transfer refers to the transfer of data from one location to another. It requires a network, such as the Internet, that provides the means of **transmitting the data between the source and destination devices**. It allows individuals and organizations to share and exchange information, **regardless of their physical location**.

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">NOTE:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
With remote data transfer, data can be sent from a source device, such as a computer, to a destination device, such as another computer or a server, using a variety of protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and cloud storage services.<br>
<b>Remote data transfer is not possible without a network.</b> Without a network, data can only be transferred directly between two devices using a physical connection, such as a USB drive or an external hard drive.
</span>
</div><br>

Remote data transfer can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as:
* sharing files and documents,
* backing up data,
* transferring large amounts of data between systems,
* distributing software and updates.

<span style="color: #ff3870;font-weight: 500;">Remote data transfer enables greater collaboration and productivity by making it possible to access and share information from anywhere, at any time.</span>

# Remote data transfer options

## Secure Data Transfer in Science

The **need for secure data transfer in research** is paramount due to the sensitive nature of the data being transmitted. Research often involves the collection and analysis of sensitive and confidential information, such as personal information, intellectual property, trade secrets, and medical records. If this information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could have serious consequences, such as identity theft, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or loss of confidential information.

Here are some of the key reasons why secure data transfer is important in research:

* **CONFIDENTIALITY** <br>
<i>Research data often contains sensitive information that must be kept confidential to protect the privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of the research itself. Secure data transfer ensures that this information is transmitted over a secure connection and is protected from unauthorized access.</i>

* **INTEGRITY** <br>
<i>The accuracy and completeness of research data is crucial for the validity of the results. Secure data transfer helps to ensure the integrity of the data by providing mechanisms to detect and prevent any unauthorized changes or tampering with the data during transmission.</i>

* **COMPLIANCE** <br>
<i>Many research projects are subject to regulatory requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Secure data transfer helps to ensure compliance with these regulations by providing secure and encrypted methods of transmitting data.</i>

* **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY** <br>
<i>Research often involves the creation of new ideas and concepts that may have commercial value. Secure data transfer helps to protect the intellectual property of the researchers by ensuring that confidential information is transmitted securely and is protected from unauthorized access.</i>

* **EFFICIENCY** <br>
<i>Secure data transfer allows researchers to collaborate and share data in real-time, regardless of their location. This can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of research projects and can facilitate collaboration between researchers across multiple institutions.
</i>

### • *Good Practices*

When transferring any research data, there are several practices and techniques that **should be avoided** in order to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data:

* **Avoid unencrypted connections:** <br>
<i>Unencrypted connections, such as <b>FTP or HTTP are NOT secure</b> and can leave the data vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. Instead, use encrypted connections, such as SFTP, HTTPS, or VPN, to ensure that the data is transmitted securely.</i>

* **Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks:** <br>
<i>Public Wi-Fi networks are NOT secure and can be easily intercepted by unauthorized third parties. Instead, **use a secure and encrypted connection, such as a VPN**, to ensure that the data is transmitted securely.</i>

* **Avoid using weak passwords:** <br>
<i>Weak passwords can be easily cracked by attackers, putting the data at risk. Instead, use strong and unique passwords and implement multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.</i>

* **Avoid transmitting sensitive information without permission:** <br>
<i>Before transmitting sensitive data, it is important to obtain permission from the owner of the data and to ensure that the data is properly secured.</i>

* **Avoid using personal email:** <br>
<i>Personal email accounts are not designed for secure data transfer and can be vulnerable to interception, unauthorized access, and data loss. Instead, use secure file transfer services or encrypted email services that are specifically designed for secure data transfer.</i>

* **Avoid using removable media:** <br>
<i>Removable media, such as USB drives, can be easily lost or stolen, putting the data at risk. Instead, **use secure file transfer services (e.g., Globus) or encrypted cloud storage services (e.g., your organization Box)** that are specifically designed for secure data transfer.</i>

# 1. Online **File Sharing** Services

There are several online file sharing services, which allow users to upload, store, and share files with others. These services offer the convenience of being accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection, and they often include advanced collaboration features such as the ability to share files with others and work on them together in real-time.

It is a high-performance, parallel-data transfer protocol designed for large-scale data transfers, especially for HPC and scientific computing. GridFTP uses multiple parallel streams to transfer data, which can significantly speed up data transfer times for large files.

## • FTP client

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between computers over the internet. The protocol was designed to be simple and efficient, allowing for the easy transfer of large files between hosts. Many websites and online resources offer FTP access, which allows users to download files directly to their local machine using an FTP client.

<div style="background: #dff5b3; padding: 15px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">NOTE:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
FTP works by establishing a connection between a client and a server. The client is typically an FTP software application, also known as an <b>FTP client</b>, while the server is a remote computer that stores the files to be transferred. The FTP client uses the protocol to send commands to the server to download or upload files. <br><br>
<b>FTP is not a secure protocol</b>, as data is transferred in plain text and can be intercepted by third parties. As such, it is recommended to <b>use a secure file transfer protocol</b>, such as <b>SFTP</b> (Secure File Transfer Protocol) or <b>FTPS</b> (FTP over SSL), for transferring sensitive data.
</span>
</div><br>

**QUICK GUIDE**

**1. To download data from an online resource using FTP, you first need to have an FTP client installed on your local machine.** <br>
There are several popular FTP clients available, including:
* <a href="https://filezilla-project.org" target="_blank">FileZilla  ⤴</a>, a **cross platform open-source** FTP solution supporting FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and some cloud-based file transfer protocols
* <a href="https://" target="_blank">Cyberduck  ⤴</a>, a libre server and cloud storage browser for **Mac and Windows** with support for FTP, SFTP, and some cloud-based file transfer protocols
* <a href="https://" target="_blank">WinSCP  ⤴</a>, a popular FTP client for **Microsoft Windows** supporting FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and some cloud-based file transfer protocols

**2.** Once you have an FTP client installed, you can use it to **connect to the server hosting the files** you want to download. <br>
<i>To establish a connection, you will need to <b>enter the hostname or IP address of the server, as well as your login credentials</b>, such as your username and password.</i>

**3.** Once you have established a connection, you can browse the files and directories stored on the server, and select the files you want to download. <br>
<i>You can then use the FTP client to initiate the file transfer and monitor its progress.</i>

<span style="color: #ff3870;font-weight: 500;">Some FTP clients provide both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI) for transferring files.</span> *Note that the exact syntax may differ depending on your operating system and the version of the tool you are using.*
