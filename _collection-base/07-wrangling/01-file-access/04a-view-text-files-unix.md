# Introduction

Many times the results generated by the bioinformatics programs are either simple text files (tab/comma seperated), pdf files or in some rare cases png/jpeg files. Here we will show you how to view these files without having to download them locally to your machine.  

### Text files ###

The text files are the easiest. You can use any of the standard UNIX commands to view them. There are many commands for this purpose such as:

|Command|Purpose|Example|Use cases|
|--|--|--|--|
|```less```|view file pagewise with more options|```less``` _filename_|use ```-S``` to avoid line wrapping, you can use arrow keys to scroll|
|```more```|view file pagewise|```more``` _filename_|use ```less``` instead|
|```cat```|catalogs the contents of a file|```cat``` _filename_|you can send the contenst of a file to clipboard or to another file using this command|
|```tac```|reverse of cat, reverses the order of lines|```tac``` _filename_|pipe this to ```less``` commad to scroll through the file in reverse|
|```head```|view first few lines of a file|```head``` _filename_|use ```-n``` option to change the number of lines displayed. ```-n 20``` displays 20 lines|
|```tail```|view last few lines of a file|```tail``` _filename_|use ``` -n``` option to change the number of lines displayed. ```-n 20``` displays 20 lines|
|```od```|octal dump of a file|```od``` _filename_|use``` -c``` options and pipe it through less. You can see non printable characters with this option (like tab, whitespace, newline etc)|
