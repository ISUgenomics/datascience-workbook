# Introduction


**An API user typically needs:**
* a basic understanding of programming concepts,
* knowledge of the API endpoint and request parameters,
* an API key or access token,
* an understanding of data formats,
* and knowledge of rate limits and usage policies.

Some APIs are relatively straightforward and provide simple HTTP endpoints that can be **accessed using a web browser or basic command-line tools**. In these cases, a user may not need much programming experience beyond basic web skills such as making HTTP requests and parsing data formats like JSON or XML.
