This tutorial explains how to transfer files to/from GIF server. You will need <a href="https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal" target="_blank">Globus</a> application to facilitate the file transfer.

It might take a few hours to completely transfer the data. <br>
**The computer must stay on while the transfer is in progress.** You may close the browser, if you wish. You will get an email when the transfer is complete.
