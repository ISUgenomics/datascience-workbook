# Introduction

# Downloading files using wget

[Wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget) is short for World Wide Web get and is used on the command line to download a file from a website or webserver.

## Learning Objective
Upon completion of this section the learner will be able to:

* Utilize wget to download a files
* Download multiple files using regular expressions
* Download an entire website



Here is a generic example of how to use wget
to download a file.

```bash
wget http://link.edu/filename
```

A are a couple of specific Examples

*  Photo of a kitten in Rizal Park
*  Photo of Arabidopsis

```bash
wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Kitten_in_Rizal_Park%2C_Manila.jpg
wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Arabidopsis_thaliana.jpg
```

Sometimes you may find a need to download an entire directory of files and downloading directory using wget is not straightforward.

## wget for multiple files and directories

There are 2 options. You can either specify a regular expression for a file or put a regular expression in the URL itself.
First option is useful, when there are large number of files in a directory, but you want to get only specific format of files (eg., fasta)

```bash
wget -r --no-parent -A 'bar.*.tar.gz' http://url/dir/
```

The second option is useful if you have numerous files that have the same name, but are in different directory

```bash
wget -r --no-parent accept-regex=/pub/current_fasta/*/dna/*dna.toplevel.fa.gz ftp://ftp.ensembl.org
```

The files won't be overwritten (as they all have same names), instead they are saved as-is maintaining the directory structure.

Some times, if you have a series of files to download (and are numbered accordingly), you can use UNIX <blockcode> brace expansion</blockcode>

```bash
wget http://localhost/file_{1..5}.txt
# this will download
# |_ file_1.txt
# |_ file_2.txt
# |_ file_3.txt
# |_ file_4.txt
# |_ file_5.txt
```

To archive the entire website (yes, every single file of that domain), you can use the mirror option.

```bash
wget --mirror -p --convert-links -P ./LOCAL-DIR WEBSITE-URL
```

###  Other options to consider  

| Option | What it does | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-limit-rate=20k` | Limits Speed to 20KiB/s | Limit the data rate to avoid impacting other users' accessing the server. |
| `-spider` | Check if File Exists | For if you don't want to save a file but just want to know if it still exists. |
| `-w` | Wait Seconds | After this flag, add a number of seconds to wait between each request - again, to not overload a server. |
| `-user=` | Set Username | wget will attempt to login using the username provided. |
| `-password=` | Use Password | wget will use this password with your username to authenticate. |
| `-ftp-user=` or `-ftp-password=` | FTP Credentials | Just like the previous settings, wget can login to an FTP server to retrieve files. |
