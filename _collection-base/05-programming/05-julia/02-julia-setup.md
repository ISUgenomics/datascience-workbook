# Introduction


## **Load Julia as module on HPC**


Julia, like Python or R, is often preinstalled on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters to facilitate computational tasks. To check the available versions of Julia on the cluster, you can use the command:
```bash
module avail julia
```

![05_julia_module.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_module.png)

If multiple versions are listed, you can select and load a specific version using:
```bash
module load julia/version              # e.g., module load julia/1.5.1
```
Confirm the successful Julia activation with command:
```
julia --version
```

Then you can use Julia in your current session on the cluster.

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
On **Atlas cluster**, Julia is available as a module in `version 1.5`, and <br> on **Ceres cluster**, it's available in `version 1.7` (October 2023). <br> Depending on the version compatibility with your project dependencies, you can choose the cluster that best suits your needs. If neither of these versions aligns with your project, **you have the option to install a different Julia version in your user space**. For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the section {% include target_link href=552 section="#install-julia-in-selected-version" text="Install Julia in selected version" %} in this tutorial.
</div>


## **Install Julia in selected version**

* explore options for installing Julia at [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

**RECOMMENDED ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE** <br>
Install Julia with [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) - a Rust-based cross-platform Julia installer & version manager:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh -s -- --yes --default-channel release
```

![05_julia_juliaup.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_juliaup.png)

Depending on which shell you are using, run one of the following
commands to reload the PATH environment variable:
```
. ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bash_profile
. ~/.zshrc
```

From now on both `juliaup` and `julia` are on the `PATH`. Also, the `VS Code` extension will also automatically find this Julia installation.

Confirm the successful installation with commands:

```bash
juliaup --help
```
and
```bash
julia --help
```
which display the `usage message` for each tool. You can learn about available options and usage examples. Explore the [Using Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#using-juliaup) section in the official documentation of the GitHub repo, to learn what you can do with `juliaup`.


**Julia via Juliaup on HPC**

You can utilize the [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#using-juliaup) version manager to install Julia in your user space on the HPC, and it's advisable to relocate and create symbolic links for the corresponding hidden directories for `.julia` and `.juliaup` **from your home directory to your project location** to prevent exceeding memory quota in your home directory.

![05_juliaup_on_hpc.png]({{ images_path }}/05_juliaup_on_hpc.png)


### Launch interactive Julia interpreter

To check the default Julia version use command:
```bash
julia --version
```
`# julia version 1.9.3`

To launch the default Julia version simply run `julia` in your terminal:
```bash
julia
```

or to launch a specific Julia version, say in channel `release`, run:
```bash
julia +release
```
![05_julia_launch.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_launch.png)

When needed, **close Julia interpreter** by typing `exit()`.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
The **Julia interpreter is called** `REPL`, Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive environment where you can enter Julia expressions for evaluation, see the results, and repeat this process to explore Julia code in a live, iterative manner.
</div>


### *Get basic inline help*

Once in the interactive Julia interpreter, type `?` and press `enter`. This will automatically change your `julia` prompt into `help?` and print on the screen the info about the documentation and basic instructions about the syntax and detailed help for options.
```julia
julia> ?
```
![05_julia_help.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_help.png) <br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b> *For help on a specific function or macro, type* `?` *followed by its name, e.g.* `?cos`, *or* `?@time`, *and press enter.*


## **Julia package manager**

In the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the package manager mode. This will automatically switch the `julia>` prompt into the `(@v1.9) pkg>` built-in package manager mode.
```julia
julia> ]
(@v1.9) pkg>
```

* To return to `julia>` prompt, press `backspace`, `delete` or `ctrl C`.

![05_julia_manager.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_manager.png)

Then you can learn more about the built-in **Julia package manager** using the `?` followed by pressing `enter`:
```julia
(@v1.9) pkg> ?
```


Further, you can get more detailed help on various commands, for example:
```julia
(@v1.9) pkg> ?generate
```

</div>
</details>


### Install Packages system-wide

Once you launch REPL with a `julia` keyword you will enter the default Julia environment. The default environment is typically the `@v#.#` environment, where `#.#` corresponds to the version of Julia that you are using. For example, for Julia version 1.9, the default environment would be `@v1.9`. <br>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
In this default environment, you have access to all the **packages that have been installed system-wide** <u>for your user account</u>. It acts as a `base` **environment** where you can access common packages and utilities. Any packages installed in this environment are <u>available across all other environments</u> unless a different version of the same package is specified in another environment.
</div>

To install additional packages to your default Julia environment, enter the package manager mode with `]`:
```julia
julia> ]
```
and then use the `add` command to install packages. <br>
For example, to install the package "CSV", you would type:
```julia
(@v1.9) pkg> add CSV
```
or to install a specific version of a package:
```julia
(@v1.9) pkg> add CSV@v0.10.11
```
![]()
You can also add (install) multiple packages with a single add command in Julia:
```julia
(@v1.9) pkg> add DataFrames@v1.6.1 DelimitedFiles@v1.9.1 ProgressBars@v1.5.1
```

### Create isolated environment

Creating a virtual environment in Julia is slightly different compared to languages like Python. In Julia, the term for a virtual environment is a "project". Each project has its own set of dependencies, which are managed through a `Project.toml` file, and optionally a `Manifest.toml` file.

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
It's beneficial to **have a centralized location for all your Julia Projects**, i.e., isolated environments, instead of creating each environment in a different location alongside specific projects. Centralizing your Julia environments facilitates easier management, backup, and sharing of environments, while also ensuring a consistent and organized structure, which simplifies the process of finding and activating environments as you switch between different projects.
</div>

1. **Open terminal** and navigate to the location where you want to store your isolated environments for Julia. <br><br>
You can create a **JULIA_ENVS** directory in your `/project/` working space on a cluster and house all your Julia environments there with meaningful names. When a particular environment is needed, you can easily activate it from this centralized path, or create symbolic links (softlinks) to the corresponding project location if you prefer to keep them together with your data and scripts.

2. **Launch a Julia** interactive interpreter in a terminal:
```bash
julia
```

3. **Type** `]` to enter the package manager mode. <br>*Note that the prompt changed from julia> to something like (@v1.9) pkg>.*

4. **Create a new project** by running the command `generate YourProjectName`, replacing "YourProjectName" with the name you want to give to your project.
```julia
(@v1.9) pkg> generate julia_geo
```
*This will create a new directory named julia_geo with a Project.toml file in it.*

5. **Activate the Project** *(i.e. the environment)*. Still in the package manager mode, navigate to the project directory and activate the project by running the command:
```julia
(@v1.9) pkg> activate ./julia_geo
```
![05_julia_create_env.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_create_env.png) <br>
<i>Once you activate the environment, the prompt will change to display the name of the active environment (e.g., julia_geo), indicating that you are now working within this specific environment.</i>

6. **Install Packages** in the new environment. With your new environment activated, you can now install packages using the `add` command:
```julia
(julia_geo) pkg> add Geodesy
```
or to install a specific version of a package:
```julia
(julia_geo) pkg> add Geodesy@v1.1.0
```
![]()
You can also add (install) multiple packages with a single add command in Julia:
```julia
(julia_geo) pkg> add ImageMagick@v1.3.0 Images@v0.26.0 CairoMakie@v0.10.9
```

7. **Deactivate the Project**, i.e. the specific environment, and return to the default environment:
```julia
(julia_geo) pkg> activate
```
*Now you are back in the default environment (@v1.9 in this example) and can access all the packages installed there.*

### Move `.julia` from home to project on HPC

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
When you **set up Julia on the HPC** infrastructure for the first time, remember to relocate the `.julia` hidden folder from your `$HOME` to the storage space without limited memory quota (e.g., on SCINET clusters it can be the `/project/` **path**). Then soft link them back to the `/home/user.name` directory to make them accessible from this default location. <base class="mb">
**NOTE:** The `.julia` hidden folder may not appear immediately after loading a Julia module, but it will definitely be created once you install some Julia libraries. To verify the presence of the `.julia` directory in your `$HOME`, utilize the command:
```bash
ls -lha ~
```
</div>

```bash
cd ~
mkdir /project/<your_project_dir>/<account_name>
mv .julia* /project/<your_project_dir>/<account_name>/
chmod -R g+s /project/<your_project_dir>/<account_name>/.julia*
ln -s /project/<your_project_dir>/<account_name>/.julia* ./
```

## **Julia in Jupyter Lab**

Julia is not natively available in Jupyter Lab upon a fresh installation. However, you can easily add Julia to Jupyter Lab through the `IJulia` package, which serves as a Julia-language backend for the Jupyter interactive environment.

### Install IJulia

1. First, ensure you have Julia installed on your machine.
2. In the terminal, launch the built-in interactive interpreter (REPL) for Julia:
```bash
julia
```
3. In the Julia REPL, run the following command to install the `IJulia` package:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
```
![05_julia_jupyter_kernel.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_jupyter_kernel.png)


<div class="protip level-1" markdown="1">
If you **install** `IJulia` **in the base environment**, you'll obtain a <u>universal Julia kernel in Jupyter Lab</u>, which can be paired with any custom environment created later. To utilize a custom environment with this universal kernel, simply activate the desired environment within a notebook (follow the steps provided below).
</div>

Once `IJulia` is installed, you can launch Jupyter Lab ( assuming you {% include target_link href=412 section="#installing-jupyter" text="have it installed" %}).

### Access Julia in Jupyter Lab

**A. Launch Jupyter Lab installed on HPC via OOD**

JupyterLab is accessible on SCINet clusters via the Open On Demand service, allowing users to launch it directly in a web browser on any device with a graphical interface. <br>
Navigate to the specified URL:
* Atlas: <a href="https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu" target="_blank">https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu</a>
* Ceres: <a href="https://ceres-ood.scinet.usda.gov" target="_blank">https://ceres-ood.scinet.usda.gov/pun/sys/dashboard </a>

enter your login credentials, and select **JupyterLab** from the `Interactive Apps` menu bar, you can seamlessly access and work in a JupyterLab environment on the SCINet clusters.

**B. Launch Jupyter Lab installed on your local machine**

In the separate terminal tab, navigate to the desired location in your file system and launch the Jupyter Lab ( assuming you {% include target_link href=412 section="#installing-jupyter" text="have it installed" %}):
```bash
jupyter lab
```
The Jupyter Lab session should start automatically in your default web browser. If not, just do it manually navigating to the URL `http://localhost:8888/`.

![05_julia_apps_in_jupyter.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_apps_in_jupyter.png)

In Jupyter Lab, you should now see Julia as an available kernel, which allows you to run Julia code within `Jupyter notebooks​`, `Julia console` and create `Julia Files​`.

To open a new instance of a selected app, such as a Julia-based notebook, navigate to the Launcher in JupyterLab and click on the Julia kernel.

### Activate an Isolated Environment

When it comes to working in isolated environments with specific dependencies, you can switch to any environment you want within a single notebook by running the `Pkg.activate()` command with the path to the desired environment. This method is quick and easy, and allows you to manage your environments directly within your Jupyter notebooks.

In a Jupyter notebook with the basic Julia kernel, you can run the following Julia code to activate a specific environment:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("/path/to/your/environment")
```

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
If you decided to create a unified storage location for your Julia environments, e.g. `JULIA_ENVS`, the path should look like `/project/account/user.name/JULIA_ENVS/env_name`. <base class="mb">
In the **JupyterLab interface**, you can check the location of your notebook using the <u>file browser on the top left</u>, and specify the relative or absolute path to the custom Julia environment.
</div>

Press `alt + enter` or `option + return` (on Mac) to activate your custom project (env). <br>In the following cells in the notebook, you can test your Julia code.

![05_julia_activate_env_in_notebook.png]({{ images_path }}/05_julia_activate_env_in_notebook.png)

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
To create <u>a new kernel</u> for each environment, you would typically create a new `IJulia kernel` specification file that points to the desired environment. This can be a bit more complex and requires some additional setup compared to the method showed above.
</div>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
It is recommended to **create a single** `Julia kernel` **in the base environment** with system-wide installed libraries, and then activate more specific environments as needed within individual Jupyter notebooks.
</div>
