# Introduction

<a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy  ⤴</a> is a popular Python library for scientific computing that provides support for:
* large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
* along with a variety of high-level mathematical functions.

<button class="btn more"></button> ...about NumPy from the official documentation at: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/" target="_blank">https://numpy.org/doc/stable/  ⤴</a>

It is built around a powerful and efficient data structure called an `ndarray`, which stands for **n-dimensional array**. This data structure allows for fast and efficient computation on large sets of data, and it is optimized for numerical operations.

<table>
  <tr> <th width="50%" class="center-h">1D ndarray</th> <th class="center-h">2D ndarray</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td>A 1D array is a data structure that holds a sequence of elements of the same data type in a linear fashion. It is similar to a list.</td> <td>A multi-dimensional ndarray is an array with more than one dimension represented with a shape tuple of the sizes of each dimension (n1, n2, ..., nk).</td> </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i># Create a 1-dimensional array of integers from 0 to 9</i>    <base class="mb"> <code class="code-block">sarr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])<br><br><br><br> </code></td>
    <td><i># Create a 2-dimensional array of floats with shape (3, 4)</i> <base class="mb"> <code class="code-block">arr2d = np.array([<br>    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],<br>    [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0],<br>    [9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0]<br>])</code></td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
</table>

<div class="warning mt-" markdown="1">
The `ndarrays` are homogeneous, meaning **all elements in the array must be of the same data type**, and they support element-wise operations and mathematical functions.
</div>

Some of the key features of the NumPy library include:

</div>


# Getting started with NumPy

NumPy is NOT a built-in Python module, meaning it is not included with the standard Python distribution. It is a third-party package that needs to be installed separately to be used in your Python environment.

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
**NumPy** is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis in Python, and it is included in many popular scientific Python distributions, such as Anaconda and Enthought Canopy. It can also be installed using package managers like `pip` or `conda` (see instructions below).
</div>


## Install `numpy` library

To install NumPy, you can use `pip`, which is the standard package installer for Python. You can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install NumPy:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

*This will download and install the latest version of NumPy from the Python Package Index (PyPI).*


An alternative way to install NumPy is using Conda. This way you can install different variants of `numpy` library in separate virtual environments, depending on the requirements of your project. You can create and activate a new conda environment, and then install `numpy` libarary:
```bash
conda install numpy
```

*This will download and install the latest version of NumPy from the conda repository.*

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
This command will install **NumPy** and any necessary dependencies <u>in your current Conda environment</u>. <base class="mb">
<button class="btn required mr"></button> If you don't have `conda` installed yet, you can follow the guide provided in the tutorial <a class="t-links" href="423"></a>. If you are using the Anaconda distribution, `conda` is already installed by default.
</div>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
`conda` provides additional benefits over `pip`, such as the ability to create and manage multiple environments for different projects with different dependencies, and the ability to install packages from both the Conda and PyPI (Python Package Index) repositories.
</div>

<div class="note" markdown="1">
If you are working in a **virtual environment**, you can install packages without administrative privileges by activating the virtual environment before running the installation command.
</div>


## Import `numpy` library

Once installed, NumPy can be imported into Python scripts and used to perform numerical computations and data manipulation.
```python
import numpy as np
```
This will import the NumPy library and give it an alias of `np`, which is a commonly used abbreviation for NumPy.

You can then use the NumPy functions and classes in your code by prefixing them with **np**, such as `np.array()` or `np.linspace()`.


# Numerical data manipulation

NumPy is primarily designed for **numerical computing** and is optimized for operations on arrays of numerical data. While NumPy arrays can technically store any type of data, they are most commonly used to store numerical data, such as `integers`, `floating-point` numbers, and `complex numbers`.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
While `numpy` is primarily used for numerical data, it can also be used for other types of data, such as images and sound signals, which can be represented as numerical arrays. **NumPy** is also commonly used in combination with <u>other Python libraries</u> for scientific computing and data analysis, such as `pandas`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.
</div>


## NumPy objects

There is only one basic class in NumPy, which is the `ndarray` (short for **n-dimensional array**). This is the fundamental data structure in NumPy, and it is used to represent arrays of numerical data in Python. It also provides efficient storage and manipulation of large arrays, as well as fast computation through optimized C code and parallel processing.

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(arr)
[1 2 3]
</pre>

The `ndarray` class provides many built-in methods and functions for working with arrays, such as:
* element-wise mathematical operations,
* slicing and indexing,
* reshaping,
* concatenation, and
* stacking.

In addition to the `numpy.ndarray` class, NumPy has several other subclasses of arrays that have additional methods and properties for specific use cases:

<details class="l-frame" markdown="1"><summary><b>numpy.matrix()</b></summary>

This is a subclass of ndarray that has additional methods for matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and transposition.
```python
import numpy as np
mat = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(mat)
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
</pre>
*In this example, we create a 2D matrix with values 1, 2, 3, and 4.*
</details>

<details class="l-frame" markdown="1"><summary><b>numpy.chararray()</b></summary>

This is a subclass of ndarray that is designed for working with strings. It provides additional methods for string operations, such as string concatenation, string splitting, and string comparison.
```python
import numpy as np
char_arr = np.chararray((2, 2))
char_arr[:] = 'a'
```
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(char_arr)
[['a' 'a']
 ['a' 'a']]
</pre>
*Here we created a 2x2 character array using np.chararray() function. The values are initialized with* `'a'`.
</details>

<details class="l-frame" markdown="1"><summary><b>numpy.ma.MaskedArray()</b></summary>

This is a subclass of ndarray that allows you to specify a mask to indicate missing or invalid data. It provides additional methods for working with masked arrays, such as filling missing values, calculating statistics, and applying mathematical operations.
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.ma.MaskedArray([1, 2, 3], mask=[False, True, False])
```
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(arr)
[1 -- 3]
</pre>
*The* `numpy.ma.MaskedArray` *class is a subclass of* `numpy.ndarray` *that represents arrays with some masked values, which are treated as missing values. In this example, we create a 1D masked array with values 1, 2, and 3, but mask the value at index 1.*
</details>

<details class="l-frame" markdown="1"><summary><b>numpy.recarray()</b></summary>

This is a subclass of ndarray that allows you to specify a named data type for each column of the array. It provides additional methods for working with structured arrays, such as accessing fields by name, sorting by field, and grouping by field.
```python
import numpy as np
rec_arr = np.rec.array([(1, 'John'), (2, 'Doe')], dtype=[('id', int), ('name', 'U10')])
```
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(rec_arr)
[(1, 'John') (2, 'Doe')]
</pre>
*The* `numpy.recarray` *class is a subclass of* `numpy.ndarray` *that represents arrays with named fields, where each field has a different data type.  In this case, the record array has two fields:*
* `'id'` *which is of integer data type and*
* `'name'` *which is of Unicode string data type with a maximum length of 10 characters ('U10').* <base class="mb">
The data of the record array is passed as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a record with values for each field in the order they are specified in the dtype parameter. *In this case, the list contains two tuples representing two records, each with an 'id' and 'name' field.*
</details>

<details class="l-frame" markdown="1"><summary><b>numpy.datetime64()</b></summary>

This is a subclass of ndarray that is designed for working with dates and times. It provides additional methods for working with dates and times, such as converting between time zones, parsing date strings, and formatting dates for display.
```python
import numpy as np <br><br>
dt = np.datetime64('2022-12-25')
```
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(dt)
2022-12-25
</pre>
*This code creates a scalar datetime object of the numpy.datetime64 class. The date "2022-12-25" is passed as a string to the* `np.datetime64()` *function, which returns a datetime object representing the specified date. The* `numpy.datetime64` *class is used to represent dates and times in NumPy with nanosecond precision.*
</details>


## *NumPy data types*

<button class="btn more"></button> *...from the docs: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.types.html#data-types" target="_blank"> Data types  ⤴</a>*

NumPy supports a wide range of data types, including:

* **Integers** (int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64)
* **Complex numbers** (complex64, complex128, complex256)
* **Booleans** (bool)
* **Characters** (bytes, str)
* **Unicode** (U + number of bytes, e.g. U10 for 10-byte Unicode strings)
* **Structured data** (compound types with named fields)

<p class="footnote mt-">^ NumPy also provides options to set the endianness (byte order) of the data. </p>


## **Indexing & Slicing arrays**

<button class="btn more"></button> *...from the docs: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html#indexing-on-ndarrays" target="_blank"> Indexing on ndarrays  ⤴</a>*

Indexing in Numpy arrays refers to **accessing specific elements or subsets of an array**. <br>Numpy arrays can be indexed using:
* integers,
* slices, and
* Boolean masks.


## *Integer indexing*

Integer indexing is used to **select specific elements** of an array by specifying their position in the array.

Let's assume we have a simple 1D array:
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
```
<base class="mt">
To **access a single element** in the array, you can use its index in square brackets:
```python
print(arr[0])                                   # Output: 1
```
<base class="mt">
You can also **select multiple elements** by passing in a list or an array of indices. <br>*For example:*
```python
print(arr[[0, 2, 4]])                           # Output: 1, 3, 5
```
*selects the 1st, 3rd, and 5th elements of the array arr.*
<base class="mt">
You can also use negative indices to **count from the end of the array**:
```python
print(arr[-1])                                  # Output: 6
```


## *Slicing*

Slicing is used to **select a range of elements** from an array. You can slice an array using the `:` operator.

To access a range of elements, you can use slicing with the **start:stop:step** syntax:
```python
print(arr[1:4])                                 # Output: [2 3 4]
```

*Here, the* `arr[1:4]` *selects elements from position 1 to position 3 (inclusive) of the array arr.*

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
You can also use slicing to select every other element, or to reverse the order of the elements.
</div>


## *Boolean indexing*

Boolean indexing is used to **select elements of an array that satisfy a certain condition**. You can create a Boolean mask by applying a condition to an array, and then use this mask to select the elements of the array that meet the condition.

For example, `arr[arr > 2]` selects all the elements of the array arr that are greater than 2.

<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(arr[arr > 2])
[3 4 5 6]
</pre>


## *Indexing in multidimensional array*

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
Numpy arrays can also be indexed using **multi-dimensional indices**. For example, `arr[0, 2]` selects the <u>element at row 0 and column 2</u> of a 2D array. You can also use slicing and Boolean indexing along each dimension of a multi-dimensional array to select specific subsets of the array.
</div>

Let's assume we have a simple 1D array:
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
```
<base class="mt">
To **access a single element** in the multidimensional array, you can use comma-separated indices:
```python
print(arr[0, 1])                                # Output: 2
```
<base class="mt">
You can also use slicing with multiple indices to **access subarrays**:
```python
print(arr[:2, 1:])                              # Output: [[2], [4]]
```

## **Create NumPy arrays**

<button class="btn more"></button> *...from the docs: (<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.creation.html#array-creation" target="_blank"> Array creation  ⤴</a>*

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
In NumPy, `numpy.ndarray` and `numpy.array` refer to the same thing.
</div>

The `numpy.array` is a function that creates a new instance of `numpy.ndarray` *(underlying class that represents NumPy arrays)*. Using the `numpy.array` is the preferred way to create an ndarray object in NumPy.

<table class="mb-0">
  <tr> <th width="50%" class="center-h">numpy.array (preferred)</th> <th class="center-h">numpy.ndarray</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td>For example, the following code creates a new ndarray object using the `numpy.array` function:</td> <td>Alternatively, you could also create an ndarray object directly using the `numpy.ndarray` class constructor, like this:</td> </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code class="code-block">import numpy as np <br><br>a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) <br><br>print(type(a))</code></td>
    <td><code class="code-block">import numpy as np <br><br>a = np.ndarray([1, 2, 3]) <br><br>print(type(a))</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="no-border"><pre class="output font-1"><class 'numpy.ndarray'></pre></td>
    <td class="no-border"><pre class="output font-1"><class 'numpy.ndarray'></pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="protip mt-0" markdown="1">
It is generally recommended to use `numpy.array` to create new **ndarray objects**, as it provides additional options and features, such as `dtype`, `copy`, `order`, and `subok`.
</div>


## *Create 1D array*

To create a 1D array, you can use the `np.array` function and **pass a Python list** as an argument:

```python
import numpy as np

l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]             # python list
a = np.array(l)                 # numpy array

print(a)
```
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(a)
[1 2 3 4 5]
</pre>


## *Create 2D array*

To create a 2D array, you can use the `np.array` function and **pass a nested list** as an argument. The resulting array will have the same number of dimensions as the nested list, with each **inner list converted to a row** of the array.

```python
import numpy as np

l = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]    # nested list composed of 3 inner lists
b = np.array(l)                 # numpy 2D array of 3 rows and 2 columns

print(b)
```
*The resulting array have the same number of dimensions as the nested list (in this case, 2 dimensions), with each inner list converted to a row of the array*
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(b)
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
</pre>

<div class="example italic" markdown="1">
Note that the shape of the resulting array will be `(n, m)`, where:
* `n` is the number of inner lists in the nested list, and
* `m` is the length of each inner list.
<base class="mt">
In the above example, `n = 3` and `m = 2`, so the shape of the resulting array is `(3, 2)`, i.e. 3 rows and 2 columns.
</div>


## *Create multidimensional array*

To create an n-dimensional array in NumPy, you can simply **pass a nested list of n dimensions** to the `numpy.array()` function. The shape of the resulting array will be determined by the number of elements in each dimension of the nested list.

Here is an example of a **3-dimensional** NumPy array with shape (2, 2, 3):
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([
                [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],         # layer 1: 2 rows of 3 elements each
                [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]       # layer 2: 2 rows of 3 elements each
              ])
```
*This creates a 3-dimensional array with shape (2, 2, 3), where the first dimension has length 2, the second dimension has length 2, and the third dimension has length 3. The array contains two "layers", each of which contains two "rows" of three elements each.*

<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(arr)
[[[ 1  2  3]
  [ 4  5  6]]

 [[ 7  8  9]
  [10 11 12]]]
</pre>

<base class="mt">
Here is an example of a **4-dimensional** NumPy array with shape (2, 3, 4, 5):
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([
                [                                            #  layer 1
                 [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]],               ## block 1: 2 rows of 4 elements
                 [[9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]],        ## block 2: 2 rows of 4 elements
                 [[17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24]]        ## block 3: 2 rows of 4 elements
                ],
                [                                            #  layer 2
                 [[25, 26, 27, 28], [29, 30, 31, 32]],       ## block 1: 2 rows of 4 elements
                 [[33, 34, 35, 36], [37, 38, 39, 40]],       ## block 2: 2 rows of 4 elements
                 [[41, 42, 43, 44], [45, 46, 47, 48]]        ## block 3: 2 rows of 4 elements
                ]
               ])
```
*This creates an array with two layers, each of which contains three "blocks", each of which contains two "rows" of four elements each. In this example, the array has four dimensions:*
* *The first dimension has length 2, indicating that there are two "layers" in the array.*
* *The second dimension has length 3, indicating that each layer has three "blocks".*
* *The third dimension has length 2, indicating that each block has two "rows".*
* *The fourth dimension has length 4, indicating that each row has four elements.*

## **Create NumPy matrices**

A matrix is a special case of a multidimensional **array with two dimensions**. You can create a matrix using the `np.matrix` function, which takes a nested list or 2D array as an argument:

```python
import numpy as np
l = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]            # nested list composed of 2 inner lists
a = np.matrix(l)                # numpy 2D array of 2 rows and 2 columns

print(a)
```
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-1"></b>print(a)
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
</pre>

<base class="mt">
You can also create a matrix using the `np.array` function and passing a nested list or 2D array as an argument:
```python
import numpy as np
l = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]                    # nested list composed of 2 inner lists
a = np.array(l, dtype=np.matrix)        # numpy 2D array of 2 rows and 2 columns

print(a)
```

## *2D array vs. matrix*

In NumPy, a **2D array** is a general term that refers to an array with two dimensions. It can be created using the `np.array` function. A NumPy **matrix** is a subclass of a 2D array that has specific properties and behaviors. It is created using the `np.matrix` function. One key difference between a matrix and a 2D array is the way that they handle matrix multiplication.

Note that with matrices, you can use the `*` **operator** to perform <u>matrix multiplication</u> instead of the `np.dot` function. This can make the code more concise and easier to read.
</div>
<div class="note" markdown="1">
In addition, matrices have some additional methods that are not available for 2D arrays. <br>*([see section below](#functions-for-matrix-operations))*
</div>


## *Functions for Matrix operations*

NumPy provides a range of functions for performing matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication, inversion, and determinant calculation. These methods are all specific to NumPy matrices, rather than NumPy ndarrays in general.
These functions are available in the `np.linalg` module.

Let's assume we have a matrix:
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])        # 2D array
mat = np.matrix(arr)                    # matrix
```


| method  | usage       | output                 | description |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| A       | mat.A       | [[1 2] [3 4]]          | Returns the base array of the matrix. <br>*This simply returns the original ndarray that was used to create the matrix.* |
| A1      | mat.A1      | [1 2 3 4]              | Returns the flattened base array of the matrix. <br>*This is the same as A, except that the resulting array is flattened (i.e., converted to a 1D array).* |
| H       | mat.H       | [[1 3] [2 4]]          | Returns the conjugate transpose of the matrix. <br>*This is equivalent to taking the transpose of the matrix and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.* |
| I       | mat.I       | [[-2. 1.] [ 1.5 -0.5]] | Returns the inverse of the matrix. <br>*Note that the matrix must be square in order to have an inverse.*  |
| T       | mat.T       | [[1 3] [2 4]]          | Returns the transpose of the matrix. <br>*This is equivalent to "flipping" the matrix along its diagonal.* |
| conj    | mat.conj    | [[1.-0.j 2.-0.j] [3.-0.j 4.-0.j]]| Returns the complex conjugate of the matrix. <br>*This is equivalent to taking the complex conjugate of each element of the matrix.* |
| getA    | mat.getA    | *see A*                | Returns the base array of the matrix.           |
| getA1   | mat.getA1   | *see A1*               | Returns the flattened base array of the matrix. |
| getH    | mat.getH    | *see H*                | Returns the conjugate transpose of the matrix.  |
| getI    | mat.getI    | *see I*                | Returns the inverse of the matrix.              |
| getT    | mat.getT    | *see T*                | Returns the transpose of the matrix.            |
| getconj | mat.getconj | *see conj*             | Returns the complex conjugate of the matrix.    |

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
Note that these methods are **NOT available for NumPy arrays**. However, some of them can be emulated using NumPy array methods. For example, the transpose of an array can be calculated using the `np.transpose` function, and the inverse of a matrix can be calculated using the `np.linalg.inv` function.

## Read and Write to a file

NumPy provides several options for Input/Output (I/O) operations for reading and writing data from and to various file formats. The complete list of available options can be explored in the official NumPy documentation at <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.io.html" target="_blank">https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.io.html  ⤴</a>

Some of the popular I/O options are:
* `np.save()` and `np.load()`
* `np.savetxt()` and `np.loadtxt()`
* `np.genfromtxt()`

### *np.save() & np.load()*

These are the most basic functions provided by NumPy for **saving and loading arrays in the binary `.npy` format**.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
The `.npy` **format** is a binary format that stores the data in a raw binary format.
</div>

The `np.save()` function saves an array to a binary file in `.npy` format, while the `np.load()` function loads the data from the binary file into an array.

<button class="btn example"></button>
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a sample array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Saving the array to a binary file
np.save('sample.npy', arr)

# Loading the data from the binary file
loaded_arr = np.load('sample.npy')

print(loaded_arr)
```

### *np.savetxt() & np.loadtxt()*

These functions are used for **reading and writing arrays in text format**. The `np.savetxt()` function saves an array to a text file in a specified format, while the `np.loadtxt()` function loads the data from a text file into an array.

<button class="btn example"></button>
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a sample array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Saving the array to a text file
np.savetxt('sample.txt', arr)

# Loading the data from the text file
loaded_arr = np.loadtxt('sample.txt')

print(loaded_arr)
```

### *np.genfromtxt()*

This function is used to **load data from a text file with missing values**. It returns an array with the missing values replaced with a default value or a specified value.

<button class="btn example"></button>
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a sample text file with missing values
with open('sample.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('1,2,3\n4,5,\n7,,9\n')

# Loading the data from the text file with missing values
loaded_arr = np.genfromtxt('sample.txt', delimiter=',', filling_values=0)

print(loaded_arr)
```
