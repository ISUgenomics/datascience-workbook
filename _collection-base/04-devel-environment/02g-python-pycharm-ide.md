# 1. Installing PyCharm

<div class="note" markdown="1">
PyCharm is available in two editions: the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/" target="_blank">Community Edition  ⤴</a>, which is free and open-source, and the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/" target="_blank">Professional Edition  ⤴</a>, which is a paid version with additional features like support for web development, database integration, and remote development.
</div>

![02_python-pycharm-download.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-download.png)

**You have two options to choose from when installing PyCharm:** <br>
* the Toolbox App, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#toolbox" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#toolbox  ⤴</a> <br>
* a standalone installation, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone  ⤴</a>

**The Toolbox App** is a unified installer that can be used to install, manage, and update **multiple JetBrains IDEs, including PyCharm**. It provides a centralized location to manage all of your JetBrains tools and provides easy access to all the installed tools. With the Toolbox App, you can easily update all your JetBrains IDEs from a single interface and install new IDEs with just a few clicks.

**A standalone installation** of PyCharm involves downloading and running a **separate installer for your operating system**. With a standalone installation, you have more control over the installation process and can customize which components of PyCharm to install and where to install them. Standalone installations are also a good option if you need to perform advanced installation tasks.

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
If you only plan on coding in Python, either installation option will work well for you. The **Toolbox App** is a good option with a simple, streamlined installation process, and that is why it **is recommended installation method**. It also provides you flexibility in using multiple JetBrains IDEs if you decide so in the future.

# 2. Creating Project

When you use PyCharm for the first time, the "Projects" section in the general options will be fairly basic. The main options that you will see include **creating** a new project, **opening** an existing project or **downloading a project** from a version control system (VCS) repository such as Git, Subversion, or Mercurial.

![02_python-pycharm-project.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project.png)


## **First project**

**If you choose to create a new project**, you will be able to specify a Python version, provide the project name and location, select virtual environment, and automatically create the `main.py` Python script file.

![02_python-pycharm-project.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project-create.png)

1. Choose the project location and name your project to create a new directory for it.

2. If collapsed, expand the `Python Interpreter` section and select the method to create a new environment. The most common options include:

   <b class="prefix-2"></b>`virtualenv` &emsp;<b class="prefix-2"></b>`pipenv` &emsp;<b class="prefix-2"></b>`conda` &emsp;<b class="prefix-2"></b>`poetry`
   <div class="more" markdown="1">
   ...about creating and managing Python environments from the practical tutorial <a class="t-links" href=423 title="true"></a> (see section <a class="t-links" href=423 section="#3-manage-python-environments">3. Manage Python environments</a>)
   </div>
   <div class="protip" markdown="1">
   Python best practice is to **create a** `virtualenv` **for each project**. <br> In most cases, PyCharm create a new virtual environment automatically and you don't need to configure anything.
   </div>


3. You can choose to select or deselect the checkbox for the automatic creation of a `main.py` file. Typically this file is intended to contain the code that launches your multi-file application. For a simple project, all your code can exist within this single file. You can keep the name `main.py` or change it for something more meaningful.

4. Click the <button class="btn">Create</button> button located in the bottom right corner of the dialog window.


###  *Panels in the project interface*

Once you create a new project in PyCharm, you will be taken to the project interface, which includes several key components:

&ensp; &ensp; (1) `Toolbar`  &emsp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (3) `Editor panel` &emsp;&ensp; (5)`Panel Manager`<br>
&ensp; &ensp; (2) `Project panel`  &emsp;        (4) `Navigator Bar` &emsp; (6)`Status bar`


![02_python-pycharm-project.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project-options.png)

**Toolbar**

The toolbar *(1, blue box)* is located at the top of the PyCharm window, and contains various buttons and icons that allow you to perform common actions, such as running your code, debugging your code, and navigating to different parts of your project.

**Project panel**

Project panel *(2, pink box)* is typically located on the left side of the PyCharm window. You can toggle it on and off by clicking the "Project" button in the left-hand toolbar. Within the Project pane, you can navigate through your project's directories and files. You can expand and collapse the various nodes, and select individual files to edit.

**Editor panel**

Editor panel *(3, pink box)* is typically located in the center of the PyCharm window. When you open a file in the project pane, it will be displayed in the editor pane. You can open additional tabs in the editor pane by double-clicking on files in the project pane, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + N` *(replace* `Ctrl` *with* `cmd` *on macOS)*.<br>
*By default, PyCharm opens the main file for your project (e.g. "main.py" for a Python project) in the editor pane.*

**Navigator Bar**

Navigator Bar *(4, blue box)* is located at the top of the editor pane, and displays the path to the currently open file. Using the dropdown menu *(folded under three vertically-stacked dots in the top-right corner)*, you can quickly navigate to different files in your project or bookmark open tabs. Above, there is an additional menu bar, allowing you to quickly `run` or `debug` the currently opened file or `search` for classes, files, tools, actions, and settings.

**Panel Manager**

Panel Manager *(5, blue box)* is typically located at the bottom of the PyCharm window, directly below the editor pane. There are many additional panels available such as *Terminal*, *Python Console*, *Problems* detected, *Services*, or *Version Control* that can be showed as separate horizontal subsection in the project view. If all of them are collapsed try to click on any button to expand its content.

**Status bar**

Status bar *(6, yellow arrow)* is located at the bottom of the PyCharm window. It displays information about your project and the current state of PyCharm. You can customize the information that is displayed in the status bar by right-clicking on it and selecting displayed parameters.

### *Customize your Project Interface*

By default, all additional panel-like features (except *project* and *editor*) are collapsed in the `Panel Manager` bar at the bottom of the window. Once you click on the selected button, for example `Console`, its content will expand as a horizontal panel just below the editor. If you click on the next button, for example `Terminal`, it will switch on the corresponding features.

You can customize the layout of the Project view to your needs.
* For example, you can `drag & drop` the buttons in the **Panel Manager** to adjust the order.
* When you `right-click` the selected button, the dialog box will pop up showing you the available options.
* Each button has a `Move to` option that will help you to pin the corresponding panel in the selected part of the Project window. *This way, you can have more panels opened at once.*
* You can further `split panels` according to your needs, for example to have two Terminal instances to be in two locations of the file system in the same time.
* With rhight-click options you can also customize the information displayed on the **Status bar** *(marked with blue)*.

![02_python-pycharm-project-panels.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project-panels.png)


## **Next or continuing project**

PyCharm IDE registers all your projects that you worked on through the IDE interface, so you can quickly jump into your continuing developments in the `Projects` tab. In this section, you can see all the projects that you have created or opened in PyCharm. You can easily switch between projects by clicking on the project name in the list.

![02_python-pycharm-project-reopen.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project-reopen.png)

The `Project` view also allows you to:
* create a new project,
* open an existing project, *or*
* clone a project from a version control system.

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
**To create a new project**, click the `New Project` button in the toolbar. This will open the <u>New Project</u> dialog, where you can specify the name, location, and other settings for your new project. <base class="mb"> **To open an existing project** off the PyCharm list, click the `Open` button in the toolbar. This will open a <u>file browser</u> where you can select the project you want to open. <base class="mb"> If you have enabled <u>version control</u> for your project, you can use the `Get from VCS` button to **clone the project from your version control system**.
</div>


###  *Add a new file*

In the `Project` panel *(left side)* you can display the **Project tools** options using the right-click on your mouse. From the menu window, select (1) `New`, followed by (2) `Python File` and in (3) the <i>"New Python file"</i> dialog box enter the name of a new file. This will add a new empty file to your project *(visible in the project panel)* and open it automatically as a new tab in the editor panel.

![02_python-pycharm-project-file.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project-file.png)


###  *Tip of the day*

The ***Tip of the Day*** is a feature in PyCharm that displays a useful tip or trick about the IDE or Python development in general every time you start a project in the IDE. By default, only one tip is displayed at a time. However, you can click the `Next` button to explore as many tips as you wish. The `Tips` dialog window is enabled by default, but once you are done with learning you can choose to turn it off by checking the <i>"Don't show tips on startup"</i> box. *This will prevent the tips from appearing every time you start PyCharm.*

![02_python-pycharm-project-tips.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project-tips.png)

<div class="protip" markdown="1">

# 4. Running & Debugging Code

PyCharm provides powerful tools and features that help streamline the development process and make coding in Python easier and more efficient. One of the most important aspects of any IDE is the ability to run and debug code, and PyCharm is no exception. **In this tutorial section, we will walk you through the process of running and debugging Python code in PyCharm.**

## Run the code

There are several ways to run Python code in PyCharm, including (1) using the Run button, (2) the context menu, (3) the Run menu, and (4) custom run configurations. All of these options are easy to use and provide a lot of flexibility for running your Python code in PyCharm.

**1. Running code using the Run button:**

The simplest way to run Python code in PyCharm is to `click on the Run button`, which is located in the top-right corner of the editor window.

When you click on this button, PyCharm will automatically run your code and display the output in the **Run tool window**, which is located at the bottom of the IDE.

![02_python-pycharm-project-run-window.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project-run-window.png)

*To use this option, simply open the Python file you want to run in the editor, and click on the Run button. If you prefer using keyboard shortcuts, you can press* `Shift + F10` *or* `ctrl + R` *(on mac) to run the current file.*

**2. Running code from the context menu:**

Another way to run Python code in PyCharm is to use the context menu. To do this, `right-click on the Python file` you want to run in the project explorer, and select "Run filename.py" from the context menu. PyCharm will then run the file and display the output in the Run tool window.

**3. Running code from the Run menu:**

PyCharm also provides a `Run menu`, which you can use to run Python code. To access this menu, go to **"Run"** in the main menu bar and select `Run filename.py`. This will run your code and display the output in the **Run tool window**.

**4. Running code within built-in Terminal or Python Console:**

Finally, PyCharm has a built-in terminal and Python console that you can use to run Python code.

When you run Python code using the Run button, the context menu, or the Run menu, PyCharm executes the code in the built-in `Python console` by default. This console is a full-featured interactive interpreter that allows you to execute Python code and see the results in real-time. You can access the console by clicking on the "Python Console" tab in the bottom panel of the IDE.

![02_python-pycharm-project-console.png]({{ images_path }}/02_python-pycharm-project-console.png)

If you want to run Python code in a terminal instead of the Python console, you can do so. You can access the built-in terminal by clicking on the `Terminal` tab in the bottom panel of the IDE. By default you will be located in the current project directory with the same environment loaded.

You can run your Python code the same way you do it in the separate Terminal window:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Debug the code

PyCharm provides a comprehensive set of tools for debugging Python code, and it can greatly improve your development workflow by helping you diagnose issues quickly and efficiently.

Here are some of the options you can use to debug Python code in PyCharm:

**1. Setting Breakpoints**

You can set breakpoints at specific lines of code in your Python program, which will pause the program's execution when it reaches that line.

A `breakpoint` is a tool that allows you to **pause the execution** of your Python code at a specific line or point in the code, allowing you to examine the state of your program at that moment.
</div>

*To set a breakpoint in PyCharm, you can click on the line number in the editor where you want to pause execution. This will add a red dot to the line, indicating that a breakpoint has been set. You can also the key shortcut or use the `Run` menu on the top and select "Toggle Breakpoint".*

When you run the program and it reaches that line, it will pause execution and display the current state of the program. You can then use various tools to inspect the program's state and diagnose any issues, including the Debug Console, Watches, and Variables panels.

<details class="l-frame" markdown="1"><summary class="c-header"><b><i>See the steps to set a breakpoint</i></b></summary>

1. Open the Python file you want to debug in PyCharm.
2. Navigate to the line of code where you want to set the breakpoint.
3. Click on the left-hand margin of the line to set a breakpoint. You will see a red dot appear on the line, indicating that a breakpoint has been set.
4. Run the program in debug mode by clicking the Debug button on the toolbar or using the keyboard shortcut.

6. You can now examine the state of the program by using various tools provided by PyCharm, such as the `Debug Console`, `Watches`, and `Variables` panels.
7. You can continue program execution by clicking the Resume button on the toolbar or using the keyboard shortcut.

**2. Debugging Console**

PyCharm provides a debugging console that allows you to evaluate expressions and commands while the program is paused at a breakpoint. This can be useful for inspecting variables or testing out fixes.

*Once the program is paused at a breakpoint, you can open the debugging console by clicking on the "Console" tab in the "Debug" panel at the bottom of the PyCharm window. The console will display a prompt where you can enter commands and evaluate expressions (for example, print the current value of the variable).*

**3. Debugging Toolbar**

The debugging toolbar in PyCharm provides a set of buttons that allow you to step through the program's execution, pause and resume the program, and inspect the program's state. The toolbar also provides useful information such as the current line of code and the value of the current variable.

*The debugging toolbar is located at the top of the PyCharm window, and it contains a set of buttons for controlling the debugging process. The set of buttons with a blue arrow on the top, from left to right, include: "Step Over", "Step Into", "Step into my code", "Step Out", "Run to cursor". The other set of buttons is located verically on the left and includes, from top to bottom: "Rerun", "Modify Run Configuration",  "Resume Program", "Pause Program", "Stop", "View Breakpoints", "Mute Breakpoints", and "Settings". Hovering over each button will display a tooltip explaining its function.*

**4. Watch Expressions**

You can set watch expressions in PyCharm, which will evaluate and display the value of an expression each time the program stops at a breakpoint. This can be useful for tracking the value of a variable or checking if a condition is met.

*You can add a watch expression by right-clicking on a variable in the code editor window and selecting "Add to Watches" from the context menu. If you have the debugger panel opened, you can select the same option by right-clicking on a line with selected variable. The watch expression will appear in the "Debugger" panel.*

**5. Debugging Configuration**

PyCharm allows you to configure the debugging process by setting various options such as the Python interpreter to use, the arguments to pass to the program, and the environment variables. This can be useful for debugging complex programs with multiple dependencies.

*You can configure the debugging process by selecting "Edit Configurations" from the dropdown menu expanded from the "Run" option in the top toolbar. This will open the "Run/Debug Configurations" dialog window, where you can set various options for the debugging process, including logs.*
