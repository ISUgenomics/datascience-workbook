## Methodologies in Project Design

In the context of Project Design, "methodologies" typically refer to the specific approaches and techniques used to plan and execute the project's tasks and activities. In a research context, this could mean choosing between `experimental designs`, `survey methods`, `case studies`, etc., based on the nature of the research question, available resources, and desired outcomes.

1. **Detailed Planning Techniques** <br>
This includes approaches to:  <br>- breaking down tasks, <br>- scheduling, <br>- resource allocation, and <br>- determining workflows. <br>*For example, techniques like Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) or Critical Path Method (CPM) can be integral.*

2. **Data Collection and Analysis Methods** <br>
Especially in research projects, the choice of how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted is a key part of the project design. This could involve `qualitative methods`, `quantitative methods`, or a mixed-methods approach.

3. **Design Thinking and User-Centered Approaches** <br>
In projects where the end-user experience is crucial (like in product development or certain types of research), methodologies that center on user needs and iterative design can be vital.

4. **Risk Assessment Methods** <br>
These are techniques used to identify, analyze, and mitigate risks during the project design phase. This might include `qualitative risk assessment`, `quantitative risk assessment`, or `risk scenario planning`.


## Adapting Project Design in Research

1. **Flexibility in Goals, Methodology, and Deliverables** <br>
Be prepared to revise goals, methodologies, and expected deliverables as new data and insights emerge.

2. **Dynamic Resource and Deliverable Management** <br>
Adapt resource allocation and deliverable planning in response to project progression and discoveries.

3. **Adaptive Timeline and Tools** <br>
Utilize tools like Gantt charts or Kanban boards for planning, but be ready to adjust timelines based on research findings.

4. **Iterative Decision-Making** <br>
Implement a decision-making process that can evolve with the project, accommodating new information and challenges.

5. **Integrating Technology Smartly** <br>
Employ technology for data collection, analysis, collaboration, and effective project management.

6. **Handling Uncertainty and Serendipity** <br>
Be equipped to leverage unexpected discoveries and navigate the uncertainties inherent in research projects.

# Framework for Research Projects

In the intricate nature of research, the Project Framework acts as the essential scaffolding, giving shape and stability to your scholarly endeavors. It's more than just a structural necessity; it's the **strategic orchestration of roles, processes, and guidelines** that harmonize the complex elements of a research project. It's about constructing a robust yet **flexible support system that guides the project through its lifecycle**. From defining clear roles to establishing adaptive processes, this section is dedicated to constructing a framework that is receptive to the unique revelations of research exploration.

## Core Aspects of Project Framework

|| <span style="color: #0ba37f;">PROJECT FRAMEWORK</span> |<img width="100" src="{{ images_path }}/01-project_framework_icon.png">| `WHO & WHEN` , `rules of the game` , `roles & procedures` |
|-|----------------|--|--|
|1.|**Roles and Responsibilities**|<img width="100" src="{{ images_path }}/01-project_framework_roles.png">|Clearly define and distribute roles and responsibilities within the research team, ensuring everyone knows their part in the project.|
|2.|**Communication and Reporting**|<img width="100" src="{{ images_path }}/01-project_framework_communication.png">|Establish effective communication channels and reporting mechanisms to maintain clarity and continuity throughout the project.|
|3.|**Monitoring and Quality Control**|<img width="100" src="{{ images_path }}/01-project_framework_monitoring.png">|Implement processes for regular monitoring of progress and maintaining quality standards in line with research objectives.|
|4.|**Risk Management and Mitigation**|<img width="100" src="{{ images_path }}/01-project_framework_risks.png">|Identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them, ensuring the project remains on track.|
|5.|**Governance and Decision-Making Structure**|<img width="100" src="{{ images_path }}/01-project_framework_decisions.png">|Create a governance structure that outlines decision-making processes and authority, providing clear guidance for project progression.|





## Methodologies in Project Framework


| Agile Methodology | Waterfall Methodology |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
|Agile is all about flexibility and iterative progress. | Waterfall is a more linear and structured approach. |
|<img width="500" src="{{ images_path }}/01-project_framework_agile.png"> |<img width="460" src="{{ images_path }}/01-project_framework_waterfall.png"> |
|Agile methodology is an `iterative` project management approach that emphasizes `continuous iteration and improvement`. It originated in software development but has since been applied to various types of projects. | Waterfall methodology is a `sequential` project management approach that emphasizes a linear progression through a set of `predefined phases`. It originated in manufacturing and construction and has been traditionally used in software development.|
|Agile focuses on delivering small, workable segments of the project in an iterative manner, allowing for `regular reassessment` and adaptation. | This approach relies on detailed upfront planning, clear documentation, and a stable project scope, which allows for `minimal changes` once the project is underway.|
| **AGILE STEPS** *(Scrum)* | **WATERFALL STEPS** |
|1. Concept/Initiation <br>2. Planning *(iterative)* <br>3. Execution *(iterative)* <br>4. Review *(iterative)* <br>5. Release | 1. Requirements and Analysis <br>2. System Design <br>3. Implementation <br>4. Testing <br>5. Deployment or Delivery <br>6. Maintenance|
|The cycle repeats, with the team continually planning, executing, reviewing, and adjusting based on feedback and changing requirements. | Each phase in the Waterfall model is distinct and does not overlap with others, making it a straightforward approach.|
| **What are the 3 C's in Agile?** | **Essence of the Waterfall**|
| `collaboration`, `coordination`, `communication` | `linearity` , `planning` , `control`|
| In research, this can be particularly useful for `projects that are exploratory` in nature or where requirements may evolve.| Itâ€™s suitable for research projects with `well-defined stages` and where changes are less likely to occur once the project has started.|


**Choosing the Right Methodology** <br>
Selecting the appropriate methodology depends on the specific needs and nature of your research project. Factors like project scope, complexity, stakeholder requirements, and the level of uncertainty can influence this choice.

In simpler words, **picking between Agile and Waterfall** is like choosing between a road trip where you can take detours and explore (Agile) or a direct flight to your destination (Waterfall). Both have their perks and quirks, so let's break it down:

|feature|AGILE|WATERFALL|
|-|-|-|
|Flexibility | `High` - can easily adapt to changes. | `Low` - changes are challenging once the project starts.|
|Planning    | Less initial planning, evolves with the project. | Extensive upfront planning, with detailed requirements.|
|Control     | More fluid, with continuous iteration. | `Highly structured`, with strict control over each phase.|
|Visibility  | Continuous delivery offers `early and frequent insight` into progress. | Progress is typically visible only at the end of each phase.|
|Risk Management | Agileâ€™s iterative nature allows for early detection and resolution of issues. | Risks must be identified upfront; changes later in the project can be costly.|
|Suitability | Great for exploratory projects where goals may shift. | Ideal for projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements.|
|Stakeholder Engagement | Regular stakeholder involvement and feedback. | Stakeholder involvement mainly at the beginning and end.|
|Outcome     | Can result in `more innovative solutions` due to adaptability. | `More predictable outcomes`, adhering closely to initial plans.|

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
In research, if your path is clear and your destination is set, Waterfall might be the way to go. But if you're in the mood for some exploration and expect a few surprises along the way, Agile could be your ticket. It's all about what fits the nature of your project best.
</div>


## Adapting Project Framework in Research

1. **Flexibility in Roles and Communication** <br>
Adapt roles and communication plans as the project evolves, accommodating new insights and changes in team dynamics.

2. **Responsive Monitoring and Adaptation** <br>
Use monitoring not just for oversight but as a tool for adaptive management, responsive to the unique developments in the research.

3. **Proactive Risk Management in Research Contexts** <br>
Anticipate and manage risks that are specific to research, such as data variability, ethical considerations, and funding uncertainties.

4. **Iterative Governance and Decision-Making** <br>
Employ a governance approach that allows for iterative decision-making, adapting to the evolving nature of research inquiries.

5. **Embracing Technological and Methodological Innovations** <br>
Incorporate the latest technology and methodologies in framework planning, enhancing the research process and outcomes.
