# **Project Management Tools**

These digital platforms are designed to **organize, plan, and track tasks and projects**, ensuring teams meet objectives **within set timelines and resources**. Equipped with features for `task assignment`, `scheduling`, `milestone tracking`, and `resource allocation`, these tools enable teams to visualize project progression and identify potential bottlenecks.

For modern research teams, project management tools are essential in coordinating multifaceted research activities, ensuring milestones are met, resources are effectively utilized, and team members have clarity on their roles and responsibilities, especially in dynamic and collaborative environments, leading to timely, well-organized and successful project completions.

## *Project Management Methodologies*

Project management methodologies guide teams in organizing work and delivering results. Among these, `Agile` stands prominent, especially **in software development**, for its iterative and collaborative approach. However, alternatives like `Waterfall`, `Kanban`, and `Lean` offer structured and domain-specific methods. **In research projects**, while the flexibility of Agile can suit experimental and evolving studies, `traditional or hybrid methodologies` often align better with the linear progression and unique demands of academic and scientific research. The key is to tailor the approach to the project's specific needs and objectives.

| methodology | description |
|-------------|-------------|
|**Agile**    |A flexible approach to **software development**, emphasizing `iterative progress`, collaboration, and adapting to changes.|
|**Scrum**    |An Agile framework using `fixed-length iteration`s (sprints) with defined roles and ceremonies to structure development.|
|**Kanban**   |A visualization method to manage work, focusing on limiting `tasks-in-progress` and ensuring smooth flow. Imagine a board with cards that move from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done."|
|**Waterfall**|A sequential process where each phase of a project must be completed fully before moving to the next, following a set order. It is a more traditional method.|
|**Lean**     |A methodology aiming to `minimize waste and maximize value`, stemming from manufacturing principles.|
|**PRINCE2**  |A `structured project management` approach with clearly defined processes and stages for project execution.|

</table>
**Always prioritize security and adhere to best practices for data management and sharing.**
</div>

## *Principles of Secure Data Sharing*

1. **Access Control** <br>
Strictly control who can access the data. Use authentication and authorization protocols.
  * **Data Integrity** <br>
  Ensure mechanisms to prevent unauthorized alteration or tampering with the data.
  * **Encryption** <br>
  Ensure data is encrypted during transfer and at rest. This makes the data unreadable without the correct decryption key.
  * **Auditing and Monitoring** <br>
  Keep logs and regularly review who is accessing the data.


2. **Content Awareness** <br>
Ensure understanding and management of data based on its inherent sensitivity, and protect it accordingly.
  * **Personal Records** <br>
  Data that can identify an individual, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers; employment, salaries, performance reviews, and other HR-related details; bank accounts, credit card numbers, transaction histories; medical history, treatments, medications, and other confidential data.
  * **Institution-specific Info** <br>
  Data that is confidential for the institution such as passwords, access directions, etc.
  * **Research Data** <br>
  Proprietary findings, raw research data, unpublished works, or any intellectual property, especially if it is to be patented.


3. **Backup and Recovery** <br>
Always have backup systems in place to recover lost data and ensure the backup locations are also secure.

4. **Data Transfer Protocols** <br>
Use secure protocols (like SFTP or HTTPS) for data transfer. <span style="color: #ff3870;font-weight: 500;">Learn more in section <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/07-DataParsing/00-DataParsing-LandingPage" target="_blank">07. Data Acquisition and Wrangling</a>.</span>

5. **Size Considerations** <br>
Big data requires robust infrastructure for transfer and storage, ensuring high-speed, stable connections, and adequate storage space.

## Project data and files
<i>Examples: <a href="https://drive.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank">OneDrive</a></i>

Platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive not only **provide storage but also offer versioning, collaborative features, and easy sharing options**. Their `cloud-based` nature ensures that team members can access essential files from anywhere, anytime, making collaboration fluid and decentralized.

## Code developments
<i>Examples: <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a></i>

Repositories like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are **more than just storage for code**. They offer `version control`, `collaborative contributions` through pull/merge requests, `issue tracking`, and integration capabilities. These features enable research teams to maintain code integrity, track changes, and ensure every member is working on the latest version.

## Real-time writing in a project
<i>Document Examples: <a href="https://docs.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>, <a href="https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Word Online</a>, <a href="https://quip.com/" target="_blank">Quip</a>, <a href="https://www.overleaf.com" target="_blank">Overleaf</a></i>

Platforms such as Google Docs, Quip, and Microsoft Word Online **enable multiple users to edit text-like documents simultaneously**. This real-time collaboration accelerates content creation, reduces email back-and-forth, and ensures consistency in the final document.

<i>Design Examples: <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" target="_blank">Adobe XD</a></i>

Figma and Adobe XD cater to the collaborative design process, **allowing teams to create, iterate, and finalize designs in a shared environment**. Comments, prototyping, and design handoffs become more streamlined, bridging the gap between researchers, designers, and developers.

## **Project publication**
<i>Examples: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/" target="_blank">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://www.academia.edu/" target="_blank">Academia.edu</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank">ArXiv</a></i>

Sites like ResearchGate, Academia.edu, and ArXiv **allow researchers to share their findings with the broader academic community** even before publication in a journal. These platforms not only facilitate dissemination but also offer analytics, peer reviews, and networking opportunities. They play a crucial role in increasing the visibility and impact of the research.
