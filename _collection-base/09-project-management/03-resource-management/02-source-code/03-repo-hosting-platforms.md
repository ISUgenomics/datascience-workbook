# Introduction

**GIT repositories** are centralized locations where developers store and manage their source code and related files, enabling version control, collaboration, and tracking of changes over time. Repositories are typically stored locally on a developer's machine and **can be synchronized with remote servers or online hosting platforms**.

<span style="font-weight:800;">PRO TIP:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
Git repositories do NOT have to be hosted on online platforms. Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a Git repository can be stored and managed locally on a single machine or on a network of machines. However, hosting Git repositories on an online platform provides several benefits.

# Online hosting of Git repos

**Hosting Git repositories on an online platform provide accessibility, backup, and collaboration features**. Web services, such as <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub  ⤴</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab  ⤴</a>, or <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket  ⤴</a>, offer a web-based interface and server infrastructure to host GIT repositories and provide several benefits. For example, hosting your repository on an online platform makes it easier to collaborate with others, as you can give other people access to your repository and work on it together. Additionally, online platforms provide a backup of your repository in case your local machine fails, which helps to ensure that your content is safe and secure.

Each platform provides its own set of features and tools for working with Git, and the choice of platform often depends on the specific needs of your project and organization. For example, **GitHub and BitBucket are popular choices for open-source projects**, while GitLab and VSTS are more commonly used for enterprise-level projects.

Typically, online hosting platforms provide features like:
* **repo cloning** - *creating a local copy of a Git repository*
* **pull requests** - *proposing locally-made changes to be merged into the main repository*
* **issue tracking** - *keeping a record of tasks, bugs, or feature requests in a structured manner,*
* **code reviews** - *examination of source code by one or more developers to ensure code quality*
* **integration** with other development tools - *enabling streamlined workflows and automation in the development process*

making it convenient for teams to work together, contribute to open-source projects, and maintain a centralized source of truth for their codebase.


### Public vs. Private repository
**Not all repositories in your account need to be public.** <br>
It depends on the online platform you use and your account type.

<i>For example, in <b>GitHub</b>, you have the option to make repositories <b>public or private</b>. If you have a free account, you can create unlimited public repositories, but you are limited to a certain number of private repositories. If you have a paid account, you can create unlimited private repositories as well.<br>
Similarly, in <b>GitLab and Bitbucket</b>, you have the option to make repositories public or private. In these platforms, <b>private repositories</b> are usually only available <b>with paid accounts</b>.</i>
