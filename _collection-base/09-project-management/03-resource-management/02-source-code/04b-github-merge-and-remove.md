# Introduction


### Some helpful commands for your new repository

--

Initialize a new Git repository

```
$ git init
```

--

After a file has been added or modified, you can stage the file

```
$ git add README.md
```

--

Commit the file to your local repository and write a message

```
$ git commit -m "initial commit (README.md)"
```


---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for your new repository

After you have made your commit, the repository is up-to-date locally. Next you need to connect
your local repo to the remote.

--

Add the remote

```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
```

--

Push your snapshot to the remote

```
$ git push -u origin master
```

# Your First Repository

### Your Challenge

* Create a new repository on GitHub

* Write a description of the repository in the README.md Markdown file

* Create a new text or Markdown file that says "Hello world" or anything else you'd like to say

* Add this file to your repository and push all the changes to the remote

Let's take some time to make sure everyone can create a repository. If you have been successful, please help your classmates.

If your problem is unique, you can always submit a question on Stack Overflow

# Working with Others

Once you start working with other people on the same repository, you will encounter some scenarios that we haven't yet covered.

--

*What happens when two people commit changes to the repository at the same time?* ???

--

*What happens when two people commit changes to the same part of the same file at the same time?!?*

--

*What if I really disagree with the changes someone made to the repository?*

--

<br>

Let's demonstrate what happens when we merge...

???

to revert (hard) use `git reset`

can checkout previous commits temporarily.

# Git GUIs

## Graphical user interfaces for Git

There are several [GUI tools](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux) for working with Git

These tools may be very helpful for doing things that you don't do every day (when it's difficult
to remember the command)

They also provide nice ways to visualize your repository tree and `diff` commits, etc.

I like [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

---

* The [website for our course](https://eeob-biodata.github.io/BCB546X-Fall2017/) is rendered in HTML by GitHub Pages, too. We do this by simply enabling GitHub Pages in the _settings_ of our repository. Then we chose a theme for our pages (i.e., the Minimal theme). These themes run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and there are some nice [Jekyll pages](http://jekyllthemes.org/) out there.

# Git Collaboration

### Now that we all have repositories on GitHub, let's collaborate!

* Get into groups of 2-3.

* Give your collaborators access (push rights) to your repository by inviting them on the GitHub page for your repository

* Clone your collaborator's repository

* Add and edit files in your collaborator's repository

* Commit and push those changes to the remote
