The TRUST Principles provide a framework specifically for digital repositories, ensuring they manage research data effectively, ethically, and sustainably. These principles guide repositories in maintaining transparency, responsibility, user-focus, sustainability, and appropriate use of technology, crucial for the long-term preservation and accessibility of data.

This table breaks down the core aspects of the TRUST principles:

| acronym | principle | definition | importance |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `T`     | Transparent | Digital repositories should operate with transparency in governance, data policies, and user terms and conditions. | Transparency builds trust with users and stakeholders, clarifying data usage rules and repository operations. |
| `R`     | Responsible | Repositories must ensure the authenticity, integrity, and ethical stewardship of data under their care.  |  Responsibility guarantees data reliability, enhancing its credibility and trustworthiness for users. |
| `U`     | User Focus  | Prioritizing the needs and requirements of users, making data and services accessible and user-friendly.  | A user-centric approach increases the utility and effectiveness of the repository for diverse user groups. |
| `S`     | Sustainable | Developing strategies for long-term operational and financial sustainability of data services and preservation.  |  Sustainability ensures ongoing access to, and preservation of, valuable research data. |
| `T`     | Technology  | Employing appropriate and advanced technology to facilitate secure and effective data sharing and use.  |  Using the right technology enhances data security, efficiency, and compatibility with various platforms. |


## Who? When? Why?

The TRUST Principles were **proposed by a collaborative group of experts in the data science community**, including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/news/the-trust-principles-for-digital-repositories-published-in-scientific-data" target="_blank">(NIAID) at the NIH</a>. They were developed as a community effort to establish a common framework for digital preservation and data repository best practices.

The TRUST Principles were **published in June 2020**, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0486-7" target="_blank"><i>The TRUST Principles for digital repositories</i>  ⤴</a>. This publication marked the formal introduction of these principles to the scientific and data repository communities, promoting a standardized approach to digital data preservation.

The TRUST Principles were implemented to complement the FAIR Principles, focusing on ensuring that digital repositories maintain Transparency, Responsibility, User-focus, Sustainability, and appropriate Technology. They <b>address the need for <a href="https://www.crl.edu/archiving-preservation/digital-archives/metrics" target="_blank">trustworthy digital repositories (TDRs)</a> that can preserve data over time</b> while adapting to technological and stakeholder changes. By doing so, they play a critical role in maintaining the value of data and supporting the principles of Open Science.

The TRUST Principles help scientists be confident that the data repositories they use are managing their data responsibly. This means the data remains authentic, integral, and usable over time.

<div class="example italic level-1" markdown="1">
A climate research team uses a TRUST-compliant digital repository to store their extensive climate models and datasets. This ensures that their data, **including its original format and metadata**, remains unaltered and reliable for future verification and studies.
</div>

* **Facilitating Data Reuse and Longevity** <br>
By adhering to TRUST guidelines, repositories ensure that data is preserved in a sustainable manner, which is crucial for longitudinal studies and for enabling future researchers to revisit and reuse the data.

<div class="example italic level-1" markdown="1">
A medical research group archives its clinical trial data in a TRUST-certified repository. **Years later, another team can access and reuse this data** for a longitudinal study on long-term treatment effects, confident that the data has been preserved accurately over time.
</div>

* **Enhancing Research Credibility** <br>
When data is stored in TRUST-compliant repositories, it adds credibility to the research. Other scientists, reviewers, and the public are more likely to trust findings backed by data held in trustworthy repositories.

<div class="example italic level-1" markdown="1">
In a bioinformatics study, researchers publish their findings on gene expression patterns. The study's credibility is enhanced as the underlying genomic data is stored in a TRUST-compliant repository, providing assurance to the scientific community about the **data's authenticity and the research's reliability**.
</div>

## TRUST and Open Science

TRUST principles complement the goals of Open Science by promoting transparent and responsible data management, which are key to making scientific research more accessible and collaborative. Specifiaclly,
* TRUST emphasizes **ethical stewardship**, ensuring that sensitive data is handled with care, respecting privacy, and intellectual property rights, which are crucial aspects of Open Science.

* by ensuring that digital repositories focus on the needs of their users, TRUST principles foster a **more collaborative and user-friendly environment**, facilitating data sharing and interdisciplinary research.
