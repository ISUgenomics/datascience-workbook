## FAIR Principles

The FAIR Principles serve as a roadmap for researchers and data managers, guiding them towards more effective, efficient, and responsible data management practices. By adhering to these principles, the scientific community can ensure that data resources are maximized and beneficial for a wide range of research purposes.

This table outlines the core aspects of the FAIR principles:

| acronym | principle | definition | importance |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `F`     | Findable      | Findable data means that it can be easily located by both humans and computers. This is facilitated by the use of unique identifiers and rich, machine-readable metadata. | By making data findable, researchers and machines can quickly locate the specific datasets they need, enhancing the efficiency of research processes. |
| `A`     | Accessible    | Accessibility refers to the ability of data to be retrieved and accessed, possibly requiring authentication and authorization.  |  Ensuring data is accessible allows a broader range of users, including those with disabilities, to utilize the data. Clear accessibility guidelines ensure that data usage is transparent and understandable. |
| `I`     | Interoperable | Interoperability is the ability of data to be integrated with other datasets and to work seamlessly with various applications and workflows.  | This facilitates collaborative research, allowing data from different sources to be combined and used in diverse research contexts. |
| `R`     | Reusable      | Reusability implies that data can be effectively used in the future by others, and for purposes other than what it was originally collected for.  |  Enhancing the reusability of data maximizes the value derived from it, promoting efficiency and reducing redundancy in data collection. |


## Who? When? Why?

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data" target="_blank">FAIR Principles</a> were developed in 2016 to address the arising challenges of managing the vast amounts of data generated in scientific research, ensuring that this data is handled in a way that maximizes its discoverability, accessibility, and utility for both human and machine use.

* ***Who proposed FAIR principles?***

The <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR Principles</a> were first published in 2016 (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618?ref=blog.orvium.io#Abs1" target="_blank"><i>The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship</i></a>). They were the result of a collaborative effort by a group of stakeholders including scientists, publishers, funding agencies, and policy makers. The initiative was part of a broader vision to create an infrastructure supporting machine-actionable data reuse, aiming at maximizing the opportunities for efficient discovery and reuse of research outputs. This vision was later termed the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/resources/internet-fair-data-services/" target="_blank">Internet of FAIR Data and Services</a> (IFDS).

* ***When were they implemented?***

The FAIR Principles were officially introduced in 2016 and quickly gained recognition and endorsement within the scientific community. Their adoption was further accelerated by their inclusion in the European Horizon 2020 program, which mandated adherence to these principles for data published under the program.

* ***Why were these principles implemented?***

**1. Facilitating Efficient Data Management** <br> *With the exponential growth of data, especially in research and scientific fields, there was a pressing need for principles that could guide the effective management, sharing, and reuse of this data.*

**2. Promoting Machine-Actionable Data Reuse** <br> *The FAIR Principles emphasize the importance of making data not only usable by humans but also by machines. This approach is crucial in managing the increasing volume, complexity, and speed of data creation.*

**3. Improving Data Discoverability and Accessibility** <br> *By making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, the FAIR Principles aim to enhance the visibility and utility of research data, thereby contributing to scientific progress.*

**4. Supporting Open Science** <br> *The principles align with the Open Access philosophy, promoting a common framework that increases the potential and efficiency of Open Access data and resources.*
