# How to find available software?

There are several ways to **find available software** on a high-performance computing (HPC) system. For some of them you can find the hands-on mini tutorials in the following subsections:

* A. [Software as built-in commands](#software-as-built-in-commands)
* B. [Software as built-in modules](#software-as-built-in-modules)
* C. [Software via package manager](#software-via-package-manager)
* D. [Check the documentation](#check-the-documentation)
* E. [Ask the system administrator](#ask-the-system-administrator)

<div style="background: mistyrose; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<span style="font-weight:800;">WARNING:</span>
<br><span style="font-style:italic;">
It's worth noting that <b>each HPC system can have a different way of managing and organizing the software</b>, so it's best to consult the documentation or <b>ask the system administrator for specific instructions</b>.
<br><br>
Additionally, in some cases a software is not publicly available and may require to go through a software request process, so it's best to <b>clarify the availability and access rights of the software</b>.
</span>
</div>

## **Software as built-in commands**
There are many different types of software that may be available as built-in commands on a high-performance computing (HPC) system. Some examples include:
1. System utilities, [see more](#1-system-utilities)
2. Text processing and manipulation tools, [see more](#2--text-processing-and-manipulation-tools)
3. Compression and archiving tools, [see more](#3--compression-and-archiving-tools)
4. Job management tools, [see more](#4--job-management-tools)
5. Remote access tools, [see more](#5--remote-access-tools)
6. File transfer tools, [see more](#6--file-transfer-tools)

### • *How to check built-in commands?*
There are a few ways to check the list of available built-in commands on a high-performance computing (HPC) system:

* **Using the `help` command** <br>
Many HPC systems have a `help` command that can be used to view a list of built-in commands. <br>
<i>For example: `help` or `man` will give a list of all the commands.</i>
```
help
man
```

* **Using the `builtin` command** <br>
Some HPC systems have a `builtin` command that can be used to view a list of built-in commands. <br>
<i>Try these commands on your HPC system:</i>
```
builtin
compgen -b
```

* **Using the alias command** <br>
The `alias` command can be used to view a list of all currently defined aliases, which are often used to create custom built-in commands. Learn more from subsection <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/02-IntroToCommandLine/02-intro-to-unix-shell#34-define-aliases" target="_blank">3.4 Define aliases  ⤴</a> in the practical <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/02-IntroToCommandLine/02-intro-to-unix-shell" target="_blank">Introduction to UNIX Shell  ⤴</a> tutorial in this workbook.
```
alias
```

* **Examining shell initialization files** <br>
Some HPC systems may define built-in commands in shell initialization files such as `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.bash_aliases` or similar. The user can check these files for custom built-in commands. Learn more from hands-on tutorials available in this workbook:
  * section <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/02-IntroToCommandLine/02-intro-to-unix-shell#3-unix-shell-configuration" target="_blank">3. Unix Shell Configuration: 3.1 .bashrc & .bash_profile
  ⤴</a> in the tutorial <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/02-IntroToCommandLine/02-intro-to-unix-shell" target="_blank">Introduction to UNIX Shell  ⤴</a>
  * tutorial <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/06-IntroToHPC/00-HOME-DIRECTORY/00-setting-up-home-directory" target="_blank">Setting up your home directory for data analysis  ⤴</a>
  * tutorial <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/06-IntroToHPC/00-HOME-DIRECTORY/01-bashrc" target="_blank">.bashrc example file  ⤴</a>


* **Trying to use the desired command** <br>
If you know what the command corresponding to the program could be called, you can always try calling it in the terminal window. If such a command exists then usually calling it with the `-h` flag will display the available options. <br>
<i>For example:</i>
```
chmod -h
```
![Check if command exists]({{ images_path }}/04_hpc_check_command_true.png) <br><br>
If such a command does not exist then an error message will be printed.
```
random_command
```
![Check if command exists]({{ images_path }}/04_hpc_check_command_false.png) <br>

## **Software as built-in modules**
Many HPC systems use a **system of software modules** to manage and organize the software that is available. The <a href="https://modules.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Environment Modules  ⤴</a> package can help to make an HPC system more user-friendly, efficient, and accessible for a wide range of users. It allows users to manage and access software in a more flexible way, and can help to make the system more efficient.

The `module` command can be used to list the available modules, and to see which modules are currently loaded.
```
module avail            # List available packages
module avail <name>     # List available variants of a given package
module list             # List currently loaded modules
```

## **Ask the system administrator**
The HPC administrator have access to the information on all the software installed, thus in case of any doubts, it's best to reach out to them for assistance.

* regarding SCINet HPC, contact VRSC team: <b>scinet_vrsc@usda.gov</b>
* regarding ISU HPC, contact administrators: <b>hpc-help@iastate.edu</b>

### • *How to get new software installed?*

1. Check that the software is not already installed *(follow the guide in this tutorial)*
2. Consider the following criteria:
  * if you think that the new software will be useful to many more users <br>
<i>or</i>
  * the software is licensed <br>
<i>or</i>
  * installation requires superuser privileges <br><br>
If the answer to any is yes, contact the HPC administrator and submit a request for software installation. <br>
Otherwise, go to step 3.


3. Go to the <a href="https://datascience.101workbook.org/06-IntroToHPC/04-SOFTWARE/03-installing-custom-programs" target="_blank">Installing Custom Programs in User Space  ⤴</a> tutorial to learn how to install the necessary software yourself.
