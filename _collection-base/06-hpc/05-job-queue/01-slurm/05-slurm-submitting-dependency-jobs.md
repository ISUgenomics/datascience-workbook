# Introduction

SLURM scheduler uses `sbatch` command to submit the jobs. You can submit large number of jobs using a loop or if you want to run a series of jobs that runs after completion of set of jobs using the same command. You can also schedule the job to start running on a predefined time as well.

*In this tutorial, we will explain how to submit jobs that runs depending on status of the previously submitted jobs or schedule a bunch of jobs to run one after the other.*

<div class="required" markdown="1">
To understand the dependency feature take a look at the `-d, --dependency` section in the `man` page of the `sbatch` command.
</div>


# Submitting dependency jobs using SLURM

Once you submit a job, using its job ID, you can submit dependency jobs. <br>
*So, when you submit a job like this:*
```bash
sbatch first_job.slurm
```
you will get the `JOBID` immedietely in the terminal:
<pre class="output">
854.computername
</pre>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
You can also find the desired job ID from the output of the `squeue -u $USER` command which lists all jobs submitted from your user account.
</div>

Next, you can submit a job that only runs after successful completion of the first job:
```bash
sbatch --dependency=afterok:854 second_job.slurm
```

<div class="example" markdown="1">
The syntax used here is as follows:
```bash
sbatch --dependency=type:job_id jobfile
```
</div>


## Managing Multi-Job Dependencies

### *requires ALL dependencies*

If the job requires more than one job to be completed before it is executed, you can supply all the jobids using a comma `,` separator:
```bash
sbatch --dependency=type:job_id,job_id,job_id jobfile
```

### *requires ANY dependency*

You can also set the job to run if any one of the job ids compltes successfully using the question mark `?` separator:
```bash
sbatch --dependency=type:job_id?job_id?job_id jobfile
```

### *other dependency types*

The other dependencies that can be used for`<type:job_id>` are as follows:

| Argument   | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| after      | This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have begun execution. |
| afterany   | This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated.      |
| aftercorr  | A task of this job array can begin execution after the corresponding task ID in the specified job has completed successfully. |
| afternotok | This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated in some failed state. |
| afterok    | This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully executed.           |
| singleton  | This job can begin execution after any previously launched jobs sharing the same job name and user have terminated.           |
