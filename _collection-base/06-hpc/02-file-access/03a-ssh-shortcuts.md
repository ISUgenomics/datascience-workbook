# Setup password-less login for HPC

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
Most HPC resources should now require double authentication which will make this type of password-less login not possible.  For those that don't have double authentication, this will work.
</div>

To login automatically from your machine to the remote host, you can save the private/public key pair in both machines. This way, you don't have to enter password each time you login.

### **Step 1:** *Create public and private keys (local computer)*

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

### **Step 2:** *Copy the public key to remote-host*

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub userid@MACHINENAME
```

### **Step 3:** *Login*  

```bash
ssh userid@MACHINENAME
# Ensure file permissions for ~/.ssh/.id_rsa (local) and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (remote) are such that it is only readable by you!
```


# Shortcuts for SSH hosts

*Are you tired of typing full length host-names while connecting via SSH?* <br>
*Do you frequently* `scp` *files from one server to another and have to lookup what the host-names are?* *Do you want to* `rsync` *between local and remote host easily with a simple command?* <base class="mb">
**Then, read-on!**

The hard-way approach *(requires typing anew each time)*:

```bash
# connect
ssh username@login.scinet.science
# scp
scp yourfile usename@login.scinet.science:/path/to/destination/
# rsync
rsync -e 'ssh -c aes128-ctr' -rts your_folder username@login.scinet.science:/path/to/destination/
```

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
As you can see, if you have a bunch of hosts, it gets really hairy to retype them every time you want to do any of these things.
</div>


## The Solution

Create a `config` file under the `~/.ssh` directory, with the short name for these host-names. Then you can simply connect to the server by using the short name instead of the full host-name!


1. First, edit the `config` file:
  ```bash
  vi ~/.ssh/config
  ```

2. And, add the details:
  ```bash
Host ceres
  Hostname login.scinet.science
  User username
  ForwardX11 yes
  ServerAliveInterval 300
Host condo
  Hostname condo2017.its.iastate.edu
  User username
  ForwardX11 yes
  ```

3. Set permissions straight:
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
  ```

***Now, have fun!*** <br>
The above commands can now be done using:

```bash
# connect
ssh ceres
# scp
scp yourfile ceres:/path/to/destination/
# rsync
rsync -e 'ssh -c aes128-ctr' -rts your_folder ceres:/path/to/destination/
```

<div class="more mt" markdown="1">
You can read more about the `config` by opening the man page:
<code class="code-block bc-data">man ssh-config</code>
</div>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
Now, combine this with [password-less login](#setup-password-less-login-for-HPC) and work smart!
</div>
