# Docker setup

<a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker ⤴</a> is a lightweight platform for automating the deployment of applications within containers. The platform also offers a centralized repository for sharing and storing containers. Download <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" target="_blank">Docker Desktop ⤴</a> from the Docker Website. Follow the default installation process and open the Docker Desktop app after finishing installation.


## *What are Containers?*

Containers are executable units of software containing anything from a small process to a larger application, along with its libraries and dependencies. Start with the <a class="t-links" href="671.1">Apptainer: the container system for secure HPC</a> tutorial to get to know about using containers.


## Finding Containers

Apptainer *(previous Singularity)* is commonly used for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments whereas Docker is usually run locally as it needs <a class="t-links" href="324">admin privileges</a>. Docker container images can be searched from the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search?q=" target="_blank">Docker Hub ⤴</a> or directly from the Docker Desktop app. <br>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
Apptainer *(previous Singularity)* is able to support Docker containers, which means that **you can run Docker containers using Apptainer**. But, Docker does not natively support Apptainer/Singularity containers. However, there are some workarounds that allow you to run Apptainer containers inside a Docker container, such as using Apptainer as an entry point for the Docker container.
</div>


## Pulling a container image

The simplest way to pull (download) a container image is using the Docker Desktop app. <br>
**A. Open the app:**
![d1]({{ images_path }}/06_docker_start.png)

**Let's try pulling image of the** `ncbi-blast-plus` **container through the app.** <br>
The app is connected to docker hub and you can directly search for images from the search bar at the top. Click on `Images` tab to see the list of search results.
![d2]({{ images_path }}/06_search.png)

**Pull the image by clicking on the desired container and then** <button class="btn">Pull</button> **button.** <br>
Alternatively, you can copy the pull command by clicking on the <button class="btn">copy</button> icon and run it in a terminal.
![d3]({{ images_path }}/06_pull1.png)

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
When you pull an image in Docker, it downloads a snapshot of the filesystem and configuration settings that make up the application environment. This image is stored in your Docker host's local storage. <br>**The image alone is inert – it doesn’t run or do anything by itself.**
</div>
<div class="protip" markdown="1">
The `Run` button is used to create and start a container from an image. <br>When you run the image, Docker does the following:
* It creates a **new container instance**. This is a runnable instance of the image with its own isolated environment.
* It sets up an **isolated filesystem** for the container, which is derived from the image but <u>allows for changes</u> without affecting the underlying image.
* It **initializes the environment** according to any configurations specified in the Dockerfile *(like environment variables)* or provided in the run command *(like port mapping, volume attachment, etc.)*.
* It **executes the default command** specified in the image or any command you specify in the run command.
</div>


<base class="mt">
**B.** You can also **search for the Docker containers online** from the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub website ⤴</a>. <br>
Use the search bar at the top to search and then click on the desired container.
![d4]({{ images_path }}/06_Docker_Hub.png)

**Now copy the pull command by clicking on it.**
![d5]({{ images_path }}/06_Docker_Hub_pull.png)

**Open a terminal and paste the command:** *(assuming you have [docker installed](#docker-setup) already)*
```
docker pull biocontainers/ncbi-blast-plus
```
Press <button class="btn">enter</button>. *The image will be downloaded.*


# Using Docker containers in command line

*Docker can be used through the app or via command line (use in terminal).*

Open the terminal and enter the following to check the version of docker (and if it [installed](#docker-setup) properly).
```bash
docker --version
```
<pre class="output">
Docker version 20.10.16, build aa7e414
</pre>

Run following command to see full list of commands for `docker`.
```bash
docker --help

## Run Docker container using Apptainer or Singularity

If you are unable to use Docker, for example you may be on an HPC, you can run Docker containers through Apptainer/Singularity.

```bash
module load apptainer
apptainer pull docker://user/image:tag
```
or
```bash
module load singularity
singularity pull docker://user/image:tag
```

# <button class="btn example mr">hands-on with Docker containers</button>

Let's test the `blast-plus` container image we pulled by doing a simple `blast` between two fasta files. I put my fasta files in a folder named `blast` on my desktop.

### *Run the image in the Docer Desktop*

First we need to `Run` the image to convert it into a container.
<div class="warning" markdown="1">
When you `Run` an image in Docker, you're not just making a local copy of the container; you're actually initializing and starting a new container instance based on the image's blueprint, ready to serve whatever application or task the image is set up to perform. **This step is critical** because it translates the static image into an active process capable of performing tasks or serving applications.
</div>
This can be done via the Docker Desktop app.
![d6]({{ images_path }}/06_run_image.png)

A dialogue box will open; click on the optional settings and add path to your data in `Host path` and type `\data` in `Container path` under **Volumes** section.
Click `Run` to initiate a new container.
<img width="600" src="{{ images_path }}/06_new_container.png">

Go to the **Containers** tab *(top-left)* and find the running container. Click on it to open details.
![d8]({{ images_path }}/06_run_container.png)

**Make sure the container is running.** You should see a <button class="btn">stop</button> button, if not click on the <button class="btn">Run</button> button. Then go to the terminal to use the `blast` and all its options.
![d9]({{ images_path }}/06_container_terminal.png)

### *Run the image in the command line*

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
I had trouble at container <button class="btn">Run</button> step as it would not run and exit immediately. <br>
This could happen due to a number of reasons including <u>memory problems or problems with a path</u>.
</div>

There is an easy fix for in-GUI-related problems, i.e., make the container (run the image) in a terminal. You will need the `image ID` for this, so copy it from **Images** tab in the Docker Desktop.
![d10]({{ images_path }}/06_imageID.png)
<p class="footnote mt-">copied image-ID: eaeed4320e5as0b1d136533f02</p>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
You can also find images and their details including image ID from the terminal. <br>
Open a terminal (for example, PowerShell on windows) and enter `docker images` to list all images.
</div>

To initiate a container in the command line, follow the syntax:
```bash
docker run -v path-to-your-blast-files:/data -it image-ID bash
```

by replacing the `path-to-your-blast-files` with the path to your input files and pasting the copied `image-ID`. It might look something like this:
```bash
docker run -v C:\Users\abc\Desktop\blast:/data -it eaeed4320e5as0b1d136533f02 bash
```

The `:/data` after your path is the default container path (keep it as is) and the `image-ID` is usually a long string of numbers and letters. *This will initiate an interactive run of the docker container.*

You can now use the `blast` programs in the terminal directly:
```bash
blastn -query testq.fa - subject testsub.fa -outfmt 6 -out Blast_out
```
*Running this command successfully generated the output file, which I named* `Blast_out`.
<pre class="output">
<b class="prompt-3"></b>ls
Blast_out testq.fa testsub.fa
</pre>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
You should now see that the container is running in Docker Desktop. You can also use the app's built-in terminal to run the `blast` commands.
</div>
