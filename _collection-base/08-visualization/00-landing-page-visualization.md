Nowadays, data visualization is much more than just listing numbers in a table. Infographics and interactive charts perhaps best describe the need for the modern presentation of results. Such visualization is meant to make findings intuitively intelligible and easily understandable at a glance, even to the non-expert. At the same time, it should give the resources to interactively dig deeper into the details for those interested or those evaluating the merits. Let the science-based graphic design kick in the artist in you!
