# Introduction

Python is a popular programming language that is widely used for data analysis and scientific computing. One of the key features of Python is the ability to create interactive graphs using libraries such as Plotly and Dash. These libraries can be used to create interactive graphs and web applications for data visualization.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
The `Plotly` library is built on top of `Plotly.js`, and allows users to create a range of interactive graphs. `Dash` is a web app framework that allows users to build interactive web apps using Python and Dash HTML Components.
</div>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
Using Plotly and Dash together, users can create engaging, informative, and highly interactive graphs and web applications that can be used to explore and analyze data on-the-fly. This can be useful for data scientists, researchers, and analysts who want to share their findings with others in a visually appealing and intuitive way.

# Plotly-Dash Graphing Library

[Plotly](https://plotly.com) is a modern and extensively developing library for **interactive graphing**. It is an open-source project that provides compatibility with the most popular programming languages, such as **Python**, **R**, **Julia**, **Javascript**, **F#**, **ggplot2**, and **MATLAB**. All variants have detailed documentation and separate <a href="https://github.com/orgs/plotly/repositories" target="_blank">GitHub repositories</a> with issues tracking and opportunity for contribution.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
The **Plotly** library allows users to create a wide range of interactive graphs, including scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and customized arrangements of them. The library is built on the JavaScript plotting library, `Plotly.js`, and is highly customizable, allowing users to specify the appearance and behavior of their graphs.
</div>

The Plotly team developed also an open-source analytical web app framework â†’ <a href="https://plotly.com/dash/" target="_blank">Dash</a>, which allows users to build interactive web applications for data visualization. Dash apps are built using Python engine, and the app's user interface is defined using various Dash Components: <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components" target="_blank">core</a>, <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/dash-html-components" target="_blank">HTML</a> and <a href="https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/docs/quickstart/" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>. So, you can effortlessly add many different widgets such as dropdowns, buttons, sliders, and dialog boxes to support application management and user-triggered on-the-fly chart customization.

## Types of Dash widgets

The **Dash** library offers many templates for components that facilitate building an interactive web application and user-triggered changes in the Plotly graphs. Both libraries are fully compatible. Dash's main modules include **core components** that allow loading inputs and change chart parameters. There are also **HTML** and **Bootstrap components** that simplify the creation of the page layout and facilitate the implementation of navigation events.

# How to get started?

Creating interactive graphs with Plotly-Dash can be done in various computing & visualization environments, each catering to different levels of expertise and requirements. In the following subsections, you will find a guide from the simplest to the most advanced options.

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
Python-Plotly based approach is ideal for interactive graphing, enabling on-the-fly data analysis and graph adjustments. If you require only static plots for your data, simpler solutions are available. Consider using the Gnuplot CLI tool or the Matplotlib library for Python-based scripting, which are more suited for generating static visualizations.
</div>

## Jupyter Notebook<br> <em class="c-header" style="font-size: 0.8em;">beginner</em>

Jupyter Notebooks are an excellent starting point for beginners. They allow you to create and display interactive Plotly graphs inline with your code and graphical outputs, making it easy to experiment and visualize data on the fly.

<div class="required" markdown="1">
* Jupyter Notebook - development environment, <a class="t-links" href="412" section="#installing-jupyter">see installation guide</a>
* Python - programming laguage, <a class="t-links" href="423" section="#1-get-python-locally">see installation guide</a>
* Plotly - Python graphing library, <a class="t-links" href="822.02" section="#plotly-installation">see installation guide</a>

You can set up the requirements on your local machine or utilize an HPC system that provides in-browser access through the Open OnDemand service.
</div>

<div class="protip" markdown="1">
If you follow the tutorials listed in the [Further Reading](#further-reading) section, you can gain hands-on experience and access ready-made plotting examples using the Jupyter Lab approach. These tutorials cover creating various types of graphs, including scatter plots, volcano plots, heat maps, dendrograms, and clustergrams.
