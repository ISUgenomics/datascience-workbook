### Editing paths and anchor points

The `Node` tool (icon just below the Selection) lets you edit the shape's nodes and control points. Clicking on a node allows you to modify its position, shape, or curvature.

* Experiment with selecting multiple shapes and editing the shape's path by using the `Nodes` tool:
  * to refine the shape's outline, e.g., to round the corners of the rectangle
  * to change the shape's size

### Distributing objects

In Inkscape, aligning, distributing, and adjusting the stacking order of objects are essential techniques for precise positioning and organizing your artwork.

In the `Align and Distribute` panel, you can align objects horizontally or vertically, distribute them evenly, or align them to the page or to the selection.

Adjusting the stacking order through `raising` and `lowering` objects allows you to control which objects appear in front or behind others, providing depth and visual hierarchy to your designs.

**Aligning Objects:** <br>
Aligning objects allows you to position them relative to each other with precision.
* To align objects, select multiple objects by holding `Shift` and clicking on them, then go to **Object** tab in the top menu bar and choose `Align and Distribute`.
  * Click the corresponding alignment buttons to align the selected objects based on your chosen settings.

**Distributing Objects:** <br>
Distributing objects ensures equal spacing between multiple objects.
* With the objects selected, go to **Object** tab in the top menu bar, choose `Align and Distribute`, and navigate to the "Distribute" tsection in the Align and Distribute panel.
  * Here, you can distribute the objects evenly either horizontally or vertically, or specify a specific spacing value. Click the appropriate distribution button to distribute the selected objects according to the chosen distribution method.

**Adjusting the Stacking Order** <br>
The stacking order of objects determines which objects appear in front or behind others.
* To adjust the stacking order, select the object you want to move and go to **Object** tab in the top menu bar, then navigate to `Raise` or `Lower` options. **Raise** moves the selected object one level higher in the stacking order, while **Lower** moves it one level lower.
* Alternatively, you can `right-click` on an object, hover over `Stack` toolbar buttons (at the top), and choose options to raise, lower, bring to front, or send to back.

### Applying colors and gradients

In Inkscape, there are various coloring options available to customize the appearance of your artwork. Two key features for controlling colors are the `Color palette` in the bottom toolbar and the `Fill and Stroke` panel.

**Color Palette in the Bottom Toolbar** <br>
The `Color palette` is located in the bottom toolbar of the Inkscape interface. It provides quick access to a set of colors that you can apply to the fill and stroke of objects in your artwork.
* By clicking on a color swatch in the palette, you can instantly apply that color to the selected object(s) or set it as the active color for future use.

**Fill and Stroke Panel** <br>
The `Fill and Stroke` panel in Inkscape offers comprehensive control over the coloring properties of objects. It also includes advanced features like blur, opacity, and the ability to apply multiple strokes and fills to an object.
* To access the panel, go to **Object** tab in the top menu bar, select `Fill and Stroke` or press `Shift+Ctrl+F`.
  * In the **Fill** tab, you can choose the fill color, apply gradients or patterns, adjust opacity, and enable or disable the fill altogether.
  * In the **Stroke** tab, you can set the stroke color, modify stroke width, apply different stroke styles, such as dashes, and control stroke opacity.
  * The `Stroke Style` tab provides additional options to customize the appearance and behavior of the stroke applied to objects, such as stroke width, line style, join (corner style), cap (stroke endings style), and more.

## Working with Text

By utilizing the various text tools and options in Inkscape, you can easily add, edit, format, and enhance text within your artwork, allowing for creative typography and effective communication of your design concepts.

### Adding Text

1. To add text, select the `Text` tool from the left toolbar (A icon) or press "T" letter on your keyboard.
2. Click on the canvas where you want to place the text, and a text cursor will appear.
3. Start typing or paste (using `Ctrl + V` shortcut) your desired text, and it will be inserted as a text object.

### Editing Text

1. To edit existing text, select the text object using the `Select` tool (arrow icon) or by clicking on the text.
2. You can then modify the text content by typing directly into the text object or using the `Text` tool.
3. Adjust the font, size, alignment, and other formatting options using the options in the top toolbar.

### Formatting Text

Inkscape provides several options for formatting text. With the text object selected, you can:
* **Change the font:** face, size, and style using the Font Family, Font Size, and Font Style options in the top toolbar.

* **Apply text decoration:** bold, italic, underline, or strikethrough styles using the corresponding buttons in the top toolbar.

* **Adjust the text alignment:** left, center, right using the alignment buttons in the top toolbar.

* **Change the color** of the text by selecting the text object and applying a fill color using the `Fill and Stroke` panel *(just like on other shapes)*.

### Text Effects

Inkscape offers additional text effects to enhance the appearance of text. With the text object selected, you can:
* Apply various text effects such as drop shadows, outlines, and blur using the filters in the `Filters` tab in the top menu bar.

* Warp and transform the text by selecting the text object and using the `Path > Object to Path` or `Path > Path Effect` options.

* Convert the text to a path by selecting the text object and choosing `Path > Object to Path`, allowing for more advanced editing and manipulation.

### Text on a Path

Inkscape allows you to place text along a path or shape.

1. Draw a path or select an existing shape.
2. Then, select the `Text` tool and click on the path or shape to insert text that flows along it.
3. Adjust the position and orientation of the text on the path using the `Select` tool and the handles that appear when the text object is selected.
